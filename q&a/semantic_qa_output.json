      "answer_quote": "Of course, you remember the visualization of the Buddha, I think that was quite clear, with the kind of light sphere of the Buddha. You can give him this human shape like the Buddha, the Buddha sitting here, the same shape, but it's actually just light. And it is... It is giving us a bridge to pass over and to feel the qualities of awakening. So the bridge is to visualize, to be in the presence, then perhaps to let the Buddha dissolve into us in form of light.",

      "answer_quote": "Some of you might have studied enough to know the five Candas, the five Candas in Pali. Remember that was the answer of the Buddha to whether an I, a Self, exists or not. And he said, well, you cannot say it doesn't exist or it exists. It's more like this heap over there. And this heap over there, this pile of wood, where each piece of wood actually then you can take apart, you can take the fibers away. So each of them is again composed. So what the Buddha called self actually is this working of these five aspects of mind, the working of perceiving forms, to experience sensations.",
      "answer_rephrased": "The five Candas, or aspects, in Buddha Dharma are significant as they represent the Buddha's answer to the question of whether a 'Self' exists. The Buddha suggested that the 'Self' is not a fixed entity that either exists or doesn't. Instead, it's like a heap or pile that can be broken down into smaller parts. These parts represent the five aspects of mind, which include perceiving forms and experiencing sensations. The 'Self' is the result of these aspects working together."

And then it lets go and grabs on the next thing that is happening. And like this, there is also an ascetic mind that is letting go. Obviously, I mean we have all been grasping all our life and we have never the less had a continuity of it. experience. As like the music is continuing, it hasn't stopped. But the kind of music that we are hearing is more like a staccato. It's like moments of clinging, following each other.",

And so it's like, this up, this down, and this away.",
      "answer_rephrased": "Our perception is often guided by a mechanism of differentiation and comparison. We categorize things based on whether we like them or not, or whether they interest us or not.

Following our perceptions and the sensations connected to them, agreeable, disagreeable, our interest goes to what we like and dislike. and we begin to make very fun distinctions between what are like even a little bit better than that. And then that we make our hierarchies, we make our hierarchies of disliking as well.",

      "answer_quote": "When you feel a person, the person feels felt and already the interaction is there. So you don't need to wait much for the second step which will come when you start talking or when you move together, when you look into each other's eyes and so on. Then there is more interaction. But the interaction with the environment is already there when we allow for that resonance to happen.",
      "answer_rephrased": "Compassion is deeply intertwined with our emotions and our responses to perceived injustices. When we resonate with another being's experience, we may react strongly, often with anger, to what we perceive as an injustice. This reaction is not just about self-concern; it can also be a manifestation of our compassion and love for others."
