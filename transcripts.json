    "41.mp3": " Namibudha namudhaama namosanka namudhaama namosanka namudhaama namosanka  That is it, another full day of practice. I don't know if you also lost track of time in between, and to be true, I did. but now it has come back.  And so I would try to round up the many teachings that we have shared and try to make sense of them for you and finish some of your questions that are pending. First of all, I would like to explain you a little bit more about how we meditate.  this morning? Of course, you remember the visualization of the Buddha, I think that was quite clear, with the kind of light sphere of the Buddha. You can give him this human shape like the Buddha, the Buddha sitting here, the same shape, but it's actually just light. And it is...  It is giving us a bridge to pass over and to feel the qualities of awakening. So the bridge is to visualize, to be in the presence, then perhaps to let the Buddha dissolve into us in form of light. And then to sit with a stimulated awareness that yes, this Buddha nature is very active.  in this mind, the stream of being. But what we did then is you noticed, I went through with you again through the five aspects. The spaces aspect, the central part of the Lotus, and then we walked through to the front better with the unhindered appearances we went to the equal taste, the equanimity.  went then to appreciating the diversity of the vividness, the clarity, and then we went into the activity aspect as you were leaving the hall into your Asana practice or touch here, or whatever you were doing. And actually, the way I was guiding you was integrating yet another aspect of the Buddha Dharma into this practice.  Some of you might have studied enough to know the five Candas, the five Candas in Pali. Remember that was the answer of the Buddha to whether an I, a Self, exists or not. And he said, well, you cannot say it doesn't exist or it exists. It's more like this heap over there. And this heap over there, this pile of wood, where  where each piece of wood actually then you can take apart, you can take the fibers away. So each of them is again composed. So what the Buddha called self actually is this working of these five aspects of mind, the working of perceiving forms, to experience sensations, So, I'll go to the other side. Next, I'll go to the other side.  to this different shade, to have formations arising, that means reactions to what we live, our resonance, expressing itself in a house of states of mind and unheld some movements and mind. And this creates different states of consciousness, which is the coming together of the six sense fields in one experiment.  of now. So these five scandals were actually present today in the guided meditation. And since I believe that you don't have them so present in your mind, then I tell you a little bit how they are present in the meditation because then you can link the four petals in the center of the lotus you can link.  it to the purification of the Skundas, which is yet another form. But I'm not going to make a structure with you. I don't want you to go into now the scheme of it all, whether I want to help you discover that it is an incredible way of understanding the world, how the mind works, and how the same the same processes.  can be processes of some sardar or the processes in an awakened mind. It would be convenient to start this time with the front petro, you know, the front petro, the middle-like awareness, the water, yes, representing coherence, fluidity. This...  refers to the first scum of perceiving forms. So, usually, our perceiving or in the senses, including the mental sense, perceiving the forms of sight, the forms of snare, the forms of hearing, all of that is called forms. It's not only the visual sense, form, looper here in the inside.  and Pirelli means all the objects of the senses. And what usually happens in the, in the, you can say, the confused perception of forms is that so often when a perception arises, there is a clinging to it. And the strongest form of clinging of fixed  An association is anger, okay, but there's clinging all the time. The sound, and why we try to find out what the sound is, the rest of the world disappears. Aside, you know, distracted. We go with the side and we run into the next pillar. And like this, we have a thought in mind. We fix on what is arising. And we don't listen to the person that is talking to us anymore because we are... See, we call this this track.  But it's not distraction, actually, it is attraction. We are attracted. We are clinging to something that takes a greater part of our consciousness, our awareness, so that very little is left for the rest of our experience. And then, because our little is left for the rest, then we make mistakes because  too much cling to one. Now in the terms of music we would just say, well this is the staccato life. Staccato, you know, is like strong sounds, following each other like a step dance, yeah, but it's like staccato is the opposite of a congenue endo, of a continuous flow of sounds.  Now a grasping mind lifts the star-card to life. A grasping mind is not grasping all the time to one thing. It grasps and then of course it lets go and then it grabs on the next thing. And then it lets go and grabs on the next thing that is happening. And like this, there is also an ascetic mind that is letting go. Obviously, I mean we have all been grasping all our life and we have never the less had a continuity of it.  experience. As like the music is continuing, it hasn't stopped. But the kind of music that we are hearing is more like a staccato. It's like moments of clinging, following each other. Now when the perception of forms, the first kanda works without clinging, there is this fluidity, there is this continuity.  And although there is clear perception, there is not the narrowing in of the perception. So we learn to perceive precisely without that narrowing. And that is the unhindered fluidity, continuity that we are talking about as the result of a deep letting go concerning perceiving forms. The forms, the appearances of the cell.  the objects of these senses, they flow unhindered like in a mirror, because in a mirror there's no hanging on to what appears in the mirror. So it's a fluid movement and this is an image of how Buddha mind is how a non-clinging mind works. So this we call the purification of the first and it is  this middle-like awareness, this unhindered awareness. And then we move into the second Skanda. We go to the pattern on the east, the so-called other element, but it's actually the purification of the sensations of the feelings. Now, what happens when we have these feeling horns of agreeable and disagreeable arising.  We differentiate. I like, I don't like. Or the time comparing. Or it doesn't interest me. So we compare from the point of view of an eye, and it actually we differentiate the world and better and worse. What I like is better, what I don't like is worse. And so it's like, this up, this down, and this away. Yes, like, And this is...  The same mechanism as pride. This better, not only me, but also my family, my belief system, my, you know, whatever. So this up and the other which is not giving such an agreeable sensation like the neighbors or the people I share the place with, down. Yes? Less important, not so agreeable. Just very bothersome to hear their emotions and so on.  Agriba, disagreeable, disagreeable, or come on, leave me alone. Yes? So pushing it out without caring. It's the third reaction. And when this kind of becomes purified, there is no more identification with feeling turns. the judging of sensations as being disagreeable.  or agreeable stops. We were talking about it yesterday when we were discussing pain. Or when I was talking to you about pain. That actually to a non-graspings awareness, the judgment of something to be not good, not wanted, Disappears and somehow in order to make your life  possible with a lot of pain when it has to stop that chanting. Only then it becomes possible, but imagine you also do that with the agreeable. Yes, you feel the taste. There is the taste of this food, but there's not the grasping that you must have more of that. Yes, there are nice sounds, but there's not the grasping that you want only them, or grasping to silence.  and then the aversion to sound. All of this is actually hanging on, gripping onto feeling tones. This means to how the sensations are experienced. And Buddha, seeing that all what we call agreeable and disagreeable is not built in in the sensation. It's there, by themselves, they're really strictly neutral. They are just conditions.  by the world, loud sounds, small sounds, high-lenses, conditioned appearances, nothing inbuilt which makes this agreeable or disagreeable. It's all point of views, solidification. I give you an example that works for me very well. Now I like very much to be catalyst on massage. Yes, very much.  But if my partner, if she cures me on the same place for 15 minutes, the same agreeable sensation that was there before, it disappears and you say, oh, maybe stop now or change place or something, you know? The same, it hasn't changed. The same sensation turns from agreeable into disagreeable because a change of mind has occurred.  kind of getting used to it and now I want something fresh and you know this whole. And this is it's like that. You have a most beautiful music, just play it longer than you normally. Play it all the time. It is not beautiful. It is not judged as beautiful anymore. Can you please turn that off? I know Mozart is very nice, but please, please. Yes, I know he's jetted very nice, but  Please, leave it. Yes. And whatever. Yes, the Beatles were nice in their time, but please don't always play it. Or whatever rock group you have, heavy metal or whatever. It's all. Everything reaches its limit. There's nothing in-built in the sensations. And this now from the Buddha's point of view since there is a constant seeing of the nature of  appearances to have no inbuilt character of a griebel and disagreeable or better and worse, these judgments don't arise. And there is a dialect view of the equal nature of those appearances. Equal in the sense, they are all paths, they have no substance and no inbuilt feeling tones. So seeing the equality of phenomena, the equal nature, that is...  is this unshaved, becable equanimity in the mind of the awakened person. And that's at the same time, of course, also the purification of pride because seeing through the empty nature of the surfing processes, then now clinging to these processes if ever they arise and note.  clinging to the self-in-processes of others, just also realizing everyone to be of the same nature again. Equality, seeing the equality, living it gives rise to that equanimity. Okay, the next battle, we are on our journey. We come to the so-called Western Battle, which is the purification of desire, and is  this differentiating awareness. Of course, distinctions, differentiations are very much part of our life. Following our perceptions and the sensations connected to them, agreeable, disagreeable, our interest goes to what we like and dislike. and we begin to make very fun  distinctions between what are like even a little bit better than that. And then that we make our hierarchies, we make our hierarchies of disliking as well. Not so cool and then no I really can't stand him or her and then no enemy. Yes, like we have these we have these distinctions and  We have distinctions, other forms of distinctions due to other experiences that we know, this is a sign, that's the moon, that's these are clouds, and so on. So we have knowledge distinctions. And we attach a lot of importance to this knowledge. Actually, it's another one of the fortresses. So one of the distinctions is the emotional distinctions in our world. We attach a lot of importance to that because this is how we make our life.  with friends and all the others, those who are close and those who are far, important, not so important, for example, no, I don't go to more examples. And then we have the intellectual distinctions. Intellectual distinctions are learning what we have learned from life. So what I know, what I possess as knowledge is nearer and clearer to me.  becomes a support for identification and what I don't know, what I cannot distinguish, is like bothersome. It's like, you know, I don't even want to think of all of that, what I don't know. I better stay with what I know, and there I'm clear about. Yes, so, distinctions with corresponding identifications, and already you see I bring in this little fear of the unknown.  And this was the description of the Third Scanda, and now what happens in the mind of a meditator. Not giving so much importance to the labeling, stepping out of friends and enemies, categories. Not seeing everything just with the eyes of our own.  biography, not giving so much importance to learning the knowledge that we have learned, but opening, opening up to what we don't know and actually being able to live the fullness of life without immediately using categories. for me and my student.  years I was very interested in botanics. So I classified flowers, I went around and I classified the flowers in a certain place and I went back the next year at the same time to see how the vegetation has developed. I was doing descriptions of plants for the botanical gardens and firebook, you know, the medical properties and so on. Came at time when I couldn't walk around seeing flowers without my categories popping up. I'm going to put it on.  Now I'm in splendid ignorance, the categories do pop up only occasionally, but I have forgotten them. So, but I can see the flower for what it is, just, you know, not needing to categorize. I can feel also, we can feel a human being without having to fit it into categories. We don't immediately have to categorize man and woman.  or medium age young, countries, nationalities, ethnic groups, religious belongings, how about just experiencing the person? Yes. So this is what the meditator learns, and the Buddha is always serving as an example of these qualities, of not categorizing, not yet.  developing to the top, then this canda of differentiating, of making distinctions is purified. It is purified not from the capacity to make distinctions, but that all these distinctions are made from the point of view of a Self. Because this is the, we make this thing.  in order to feel safe in the world. It's like a map for us, it's the orientation. And if you have the capacity to perceive forms, the objects of the senses without falling into the judgment of agreeable and disagreeable and not the immediate need to categorize, that means you can stay.  open up to an experience of now, which is extremely vivid. Yes, the capacity to perceive is there just as before. So, you experience an extremely vivid life without all the additional processes. These additional propensity processes are called propensia in Sanskrit, and the better.  And this is the unnecessary thinking. All the unnecessary dualistic processes that are usually connected with sensations and distinctions. They all drop away. And thanks to that, we are not preoccupied with this unnecessary interpretation of reality. and reality that means the experience that we have now shines forth in an incredible  precision and beauty, without an impulse of the self needing to specify, needing to put categories. But if needed for the sake of communication, then all our categories of distinction are available. words are distinctions, right? To be able to name something with a word is  The third Scanda is the making distinctions, making differentiations. And to learn different languages is relying on knowledge of how these distinctions are made, the sound distinctions, in other people's mind. Okay, so the Buddha spoke different languages, different northern Indian languages. I was able to reply and to converse in them, to understand people, he was able to point to things and what's  very precise at the use of his words. But never, there is an identification and very flexible. So you use one word, one distinction. It doesn't work for the person you are talking to, you change. Now clinging. You change into the language, into the way. The other person is seeing the world to use the world.  of the child, you use the images of that person, you use the concepts of that person. So there is this incredible flexibility in using distinctions. Okay, so this is the basic process of the purified, you can say now the third Skander, the pedal of all differentiating awareness.  The awareness still differentiates everything, but with the understanding of the empty nature, the equality of all phenomena, with the fluidity of not clinging to forms, because actually a distinction arising is then again a form, which is perceived. So that fluidity continues all the way along. And these sensations and these distinctions  are already part of what we call the formations, the Sun's Karah, the first Skanda. So they are the beginning and the list of the 50-51-53 mental events that are called Sun's Karah, a list which could be much longer, much more extremitous enough. The Buddha talked about these in his various discourses and  In this functioning of these roughly 50 mental events, there are five of these formative factors of the creative activity of mind which are omnipresent, which are present in every act of cognition. Of course, they are also present in a Buddha's but not linked to...  the idea of a self. Then there are five so-called object ascertaining activities, verifying what is that which my focus rests on. And here we have like the interest, we have the sati, the mindfulness, going all the way into Samadhi, the capacity to really rest long time on the op.  until an understanding of that which the mind settles on arises. Of course, a Buddha has these capacities to settle long enough with any situation to stay with it in an undistracted way, undistracted Sati to understand what is going on. But no reference to a save, no judging, no...  Not no need to jump into categories before they are needed. Yes, all of that in a completely open non-clinging awareness. And then we have in our normal way of describing the sans-cardas. we have in the Mariana Abidama the list are slightly different we have the 11 Hold some factors followed by the 6th and hold some  root, clasers to unhode some root factors and then 20 more unhode some factors and then for variable forms. All of them actually are our reactions towards our attention as dealt with. So these sounds cut us the whole some ones as well as the unhurt some ones. the show.  to what conclusions we have come by, for example, looking long enough at a man on whom my gaze lands and then my sensations, distinctions have arisen and then I have a resonance to that in wholesome and unwholesome states in my mind. Now this whole process of course...  and an awakened mind is not searching for happiness. A Buddha's way of perceiving is not a hidden search for more happiness. A Buddha's way of perceiving the way that the world is already resting in that complete piece that we call some new runner.  And when relating to the outer world that others might call some Sada, then the perspective is not one of trying to understand and want to make the world better, but is actually seeing from a place of perfection. And all the activities in connection with the world are not driven by any need that needs to be a full field.  any hope, any fear, all of these driving forces are not there, no egocentriness. Actually, it's the resonance of a mind that rests in perfection with the changing conditions of life around us, which create changing mental events in a Buddha's mind, but never was the slightest idea of itself in the center of those.  processes. So what comes into the Buddha's mind, whatever the mental formations are which are arising then, they cannot be called wholesome or unwholesome anymore, they are non-dual, they are non-dual mental formations arising. Without a subject, the things that are different, a separate object is perceived. Actually, there are movements of mind in...  this interdependence and the activity coming from that because these suns carras are where the karma is created. Carra and karma are the same semantic root and means that which creates. So usually with our hosome and unhosome states we create hosome and unhosome karma. the activity, the karma of an awakened mind, because of  not even being in distinctions of what is agreeable and disagreeable, wholesome and unwholesome, is naturally free of clinging to itself and will naturally always be wholesome, but wholesomeness without a centre, without clinging to itself. And that's the purification of the force, the force, which are the formative factors.  That's why we talk about an all-perfecting timeless awareness. It is perfecting every moment of interaction with the world. What is normally the place where some sort of happens. And now? Huh? I am coming. Now I am talking about the wind. Now it was the petrol with the wind. the pattern on.  the northern side. And then we still have one scunder left, one normal, you know, these are the mental states, the states of consciousness, which are the sum total of what we live in visual consciousness, hearing consciousness, tactile consciousness, and so on, all six fields and actually these six fields  of experience which combine to the experience of now, normally they give rise to the idea I am what I experience. What I experience now this is what I am. This identification does not arise in a Buddha's mind. We are now going to the center, we are now going to space. whatever.  Experience of now is present in an awakened mind, is always with that quality of spaciousness, which here means without center and without limits. Because all the states of consciousness that arise are free from a subject as the center, And without any limitations, whether it's over there is the object, or over there...  somewhere are the limits of love, compassion, you know, all the inherent qualities. So this is the purification of the fifth Skanda, which refers to the center of the battle. Okay, this was you went to school now, you went to university for a little a little more than half an hour, yes? But I did it on purpose with you so that you under...  then better what Mahamudra is doing. Mahamudra is the practice of going from the confused working of these mental processes of these so-called five scandals to an awakened working of the same mental processes. No need to leave the mind only freeing the mind.  from that constant clinging to an imagent self. And then that purifies all these processes. And what we do in Shammata practice is already calming down these habitual patterns of zooming into perceptions and forgetting the rest. Differentiating and agreeable and disagreeable so blocking up.  and getting fix we calm that down. Not using so much labeling, not referring constantly to past, present and future. It's on these differentiations due to time and experience and knowledge. Coming that down. Not entering the emotional striker, not entering the wish to do good and to avoid the unhowsome, the bad. Cando, Cando, to...  gets unwind and to treat every state of consciousness with a sense of relaxation, a sense of non-identification. So this is already in shamata. Shamata in that sense is reducing the power of the identification and all these realms of experience. that is extremely helpful. Okay?  extremely necessary. And because the trouble is reduced, we see more clearly. Things become more calm, the experiences of life become a little bit more calm, and we begin to understand better what is happening just because we don't always create a storm in a teacup. Yes, this is what actually the Shammata practice is about.  If you don't always stir up the water, you let it settle, it comes down and the water becomes clear, you can see better. And that's what we do in Shambhata. And the seeing is the Vipazana. Seeing how it is is the Vipazana. Okay, so this is what my mother is doing. My mother is saying basically...  We have this beautiful mind that could be the working of pure, this pure scunders, the way a Buddha mind works, that's basically our potential. However we have to relax the clinging. We have to really get out of complicating the show so much.  It's still is a show, but a good one. I hope some aspect of your mind can appreciate to have once in a lifetime receive this instruction because it gives you a very clue and idea of a size idea what we are actually.  working. Now imagine I would have started on the first day with that. Yes, yes, and you know, it's difficult enough to receive this explanation with a relaxed mind at the end of a retreat, but don't need to. Oh yes, this is fine. You take them, you take the two weeks, to see that you are not getting  too much to do when you come home and you reflect and you digest. It is not the end of what can be said about these five. It's not the end. But please, this is just to give you an idea that there is a deeper harmony in life.  There is already a harmony in some sara. And more so when the clinging relaxes, you see the harmony and life as this. Wow, these beautiful principles that actually structure our experience. for me is the most...  important and to give you a little trust that the Dharma knows what it is talking about. So for us, wherever we can bring in a little bit of relaxation, wherever we can reduce the clicking it will be beneficial in this direction.  We don't even have to know which scandal we are working on. We don't need to know which battle we are dancing on, because probably we are dancing in the whole Lotus. They cannot really be separated these aspects. They are not five different wisdoms, they are one wisdom, they are one basic state of ignorance. You don't have to know.  All of these classifications just helpful to get an orientation. That's all. Let's finish with a little meditation. Thank you.  I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing.

    "7.mp3": " Before starting with the teaching, let us remember the refuge. Buddha awakening, Dharma, the understanding that liberates and sangha, the community of those who help us to become free.  Okay. I would like to  give you a little orientation about what Mahamudra is, a little further orientation. Mahamudra, as such, has been heard from about the second century after Christ, Yeah, this is the time where the first time someone taught public here.  This is the Mahasiddha Sada, who is called the grandfather of the Mahamudra tradition. And at that time, also lived that famous Nagarjuna of which you probably have heard. Now, both these great masters, they belong to dot this  It's a group of approaches which has received the name of Mahayana. So, this is a great vehicle. And the origins of that can be traced back to just after the Buddha's Nirvana, the Parinevana. His past is leaving the body. time there were 18 18 schools of Dharma 18 schools of  It's slightly different interpretations of, you know, emphasis on how to pass on the teaching. They were spread out over large parts of India. And the emphasis of this Mahayana is one to make it accessible for lay people. Oh, this is one of the great...  emphasis, not so much originally a monastic tradition, it has turned very monastic afterwards. But originally it was meant to be a tradition for householders, people with family. And cold, the great vehicle, we cross.  Their attempt was to include all situations into the path. And all situations means to make all of samsara, all of the world of, you know, the challenges with a lot of suffering, to use all these situations of samsara as a means for realization.  So that is quite a courageous attempt. It was a little bit different than the attempt to get quickly out of some sada. It's a little different what you read. And it has a lot of consequences. The key teaching of this approach is that some Sarah.  is not a world, but it's only a perspective of the world. It is a way to see the world. Sonsara is not this world of ours, but it's actually the way we lift this world. If we perceive this world, always from an seeming eye, a seeming self, as the center of the experience, and the rest separated from it, then it is sansara.  Okay, then it is actually going to create a lot of tensions, a lot of conflicts. All the afflictions or the klesha, they arise from that, from this basic ignorance of thinking that is a me in the center of the experience. And when the meditator, the Yugini and the Yugi, and they turn their mind inwards and they try to find that...  seeming center, which relatively speaking we all use the words I and you, yeah we all use that but when we try to find that, just dynamic experience, openness, no center to be found. And the Mahayana approach is using this experience which you know very well from your We pass on our teaching as the experience of Anna-Tah, Ma-A-Sel.  and our solid self, then they use this in all situations of life. So in the Mahayana approach, because it's a household, a family approach, for example, sexuality would not be banned. It's not something to avoid, but go into it as practice. it a practice for the yogi and the yogini. Why you  come close, why you live that intensity of the experience, to then look into the seeming center, to dissolve the seeming center. And that has given rise to all the tantric approaches to which also Mahamudra belongs. We talked more about that later. But actually this means that in the whole of Mahayana, then this nose.  self-discovery becomes the central issue and it is called the empty nature, shunyata, shunyata. This is the key term for the whole development of that which is called the great vehicle. Basically it means that instead of avoiding dualistic thinking including avoiding the dualistic G-Mausch, like the Seier.  hatred, pride and so on, to become free of them again and again, one looks into the very nature of that which is arising. And we call that the emptiness of all phenomena. This means that all experience at that moment is not some sara anymore, but becomes an experience of liberation. Because at that moment of seeing the very nature of the...  of course the Klingin collapses, there is no more dualism, no more subject, object and whichever situation we are free in, whatever the actual situation is now, this is then an experience of awakening, of liberation. So no more samsara to get rid of just to see through samsara. This is the difference if you want to bring it down to a point.  The current approach, under then, and the dominant approach was to be liberated from samsara. And the amayyana approach is to be liberated in samsara, to see through the illusion, the projection of self and other. And this includes more than just to see through that there is no self in the person. means that every city...  situation we live in, is experienced in this central-less awareness, this awareness, without any clinging to a seeming self, which is an enormous challenge because the most difficult situation to maintain, to reconnect with that realization is when we are challenged by other people, but we're in the community.  occasion situation. That's when we slide back easily, especially when there is hatred, especially when there is desire, especially, you know, all kinds of strong emotions, including fear. This is where we tend to get involved with the old patterns, with the old ways, we call them the habitual tendencies, the old ways of dealing with the world and seeing the world. and the plate.  practitioner tends to slip back into what we would call a solidifying attitude to think that that which is there truly exists, that there are objects which are not mind, that there is whatever I experience, that this world is like that. So even the tendency to think that the world is bad, or that someone is bad. This is...  This whole belief comes from solidifying a seeming outside world. And the Mayana, a strong point, is that it always brings back the practitioner to seeing that, hey, if you live in some Sada, that's the Samsada you project. There is no outer Samsada. The sub-sader is...  world of dualistic perception, which only this mind stream can produce. No one else can make us live in some server. No one else. There can be an anger-hated fear, desire, delusion, the world around us can be on fire. And in here, the person experiencing it, the mind stream, to say it more probably, the mind stream experiencing that.  can be free of that. It does not have to be affected by that, but it's difficult. It's very difficult not to panic when everybody around panics. It's difficult when everyone around has a certain belief system, not to enter that belief system. So we are talking about a very challenging path, and the motivation to take that path to save  to fear, as Mothers, not to say, to fear, that what good is my liberation if my brothers and sisters around me are not liberated. So I want to realize such an awakening that I am able to deal with the situations, the challenging situations presented by people caught in the emotions around me.  and to help them to realize their own nature, so that they also awaken. Now we end up with a kind of, you can say, funny situation if you want. We have this Bodhisattva idea of making this awakening available to everybody and there is the necessary understanding for the Bodhisattva that there is no one liberating anyone.  Otherwise, there is no awakening. This illusion of someone doing something for the benefit of others has crumbled. There is just this sensitive mind stream in a spontaneous interaction with all situations and not solidifying the one in front as well. That mind stream, that is the so-called Samsari Accenture Being, is also simply...  You can say, a clinging, there is a grasping. So, in the energy field that we call a sentient being, there is so much grasping that in this energy field, there is a lot of tension. And this is why we say that the bodhisattva activity is no one liberating anyone for S-Larm.  as samsara lasts, which means to be present with all situations without limit, but without the idea of a personal enterprise, me, the savior of the world. This doesn't, this is completely contradictory to the understanding. This is a misunderstanding. There's no one We can say, okay, sleeves up, here we go.  Let's rescue the world. Some Sarah cannot be cleaned up. No one can rescue anybody. It is more like bodhisattvas. Such people with this inspiration to actually do something for all the other mind streams. The Mourisat was at the Bodhisattvas, that would be the feminine form, the Bodhisattvas.  They open up to their own mind's nature and they become like catalysts. You know what, in chemistry a catalyst is? I give you a little reminder, vitamins, most vitamins are catalysts. They are present in chemical reactions and because they are present, the biochemical reaction can take place. but they are not used up in that reaction. Teaches.  present, they create, you can say the necessary environment for a reaction to take place. That's what is called a catalyst. Now a bodhisattva is not actually doing so much. That can be actions of course, there can be words being said and concrete actions of can be but this is not the point.  is to be a catalyst for a field of awareness that arises around the practitioner. And around this practitioner people find it easier to realize their own mind. That is the idea of within such activity, to be present in this universe, which to some is some sort of and to others is Nirvana.  what we are talking about the same word. So to help everyone enter the change of perspective. The big change is nothing new for you. You know already from the ego-centered perspective to the non-self. This is the Anata. And then just a little step further from a world where everything seems to be solid and other people seem to be existing.  to a world where everything is perceived as energies, as currents, mind streams, fields of energy with more or less clinging, with more or less clinging to solidity, and to help everywhere to fluidify the situation. So you have to be a catalyst like a... And the washing machine, you put something in to make the... your shirt soft. This is tough to have. We have flu.  Yes, this is like, this is the job. This is the job. You know, every practitioner has to do the work themselves. No one can do it for you. It's not possible. If any Buddha had the capacity to liberate others, they would have done it long ago. We would not have to walk the path. No one can do it first. So we have to do it. But they patiently sit there with us. that there was us, there around, there available.  teachings are available and that is this inspiration, you see? And the job of the practitioner is actually to tune in to that inspiration. That's what we call blessing. To tune in to this field of inspiration, which is there when someone truly enters Mahamudra, when someone lifts this open experience of being. and then to x  For oneself, the change of perspective. Not by the intellect, it's not something one can produce. It's somehow seeing from the belly, I would say. You know, it's not just the intellect. You intuitively perceive the word differently. And this is what the Mahmouda approach is about. is about.  And so in those days when the Mahmoudra approach was was born as it is actually taking the Mahayana approach to its limits. So in the Mahmoudra approach on purpose sexuality was included on purpose also alcohol was included dancing was included singing was included. Communication of forms was included. Political...  was included. You know, there are these Mahasiddhas and Mahasiddhas, the feminine form, which were prostitutes, which were wine sellers, which were Mahal rajas, chiefs of countries, and so on. All possible, you know, potteras and so on, all possible occupations were part, were used for the path. So one of the  of the very important ones, like for example, Tilupa, which you might have heard, with the famous teaching of the Ganges Mahamudra, Tilupa teaching Naropa, who then taught Mahabhar who brought it to Tibet. Tilupa was actually the man bringing, bringing the man from the marketplace to the brother, to his companion and her assistance and the prost...  that was still Opa's main job, you know, and that's where the Mahmoudra comes from. I hope you are, I hope you're really desperate now. Now I'm missing the word, but actually, yes, we come and then the next one, Naropa, he left his chair of being one of the head professors of Nalanda University. here.  and became a complete dropout, a dropout following this guy, Tilupa, who was a nobody. And Marpa was basically presenting himself as a farmer, what was then becoming the famous Marpa translator, had the famous disciple of Milarepa, who was running around naked all the time. And we have beautiful songs by him when he was lying on the...  on the side of a footpath and three beautiful women came along and they were standing looking at the seemingly sleeping yoga and said, oh, what a pity, he doesn't even have anything to dress, you know, he should be ashamed to be lying around like this. Emila Ripa rises, shows himself in all his beauty and says, I am not ashamed of everything, why are you wearing closes? What is your problem? Are you trying to hide something?  with which you were born, what is your problem actually? Isn't it more proper to be ashamed of one's hatred, of one's pride, once arrogance, and he gives them this whole song, you know, about what is truly to be ashamed of and not the naked body, right? So this is Mahamudra, so I'm including all the situations and we have, it's the whole panopli, we would say the your home panorama of...  human situations is included in that. All these sufferings, one of my favorite teachers is Magic Laptron who lived at that time. She is the founder of the Trutans tradition that he met and lady who mostly walked around naked most of her life and was the teacher of many, many yogis and yoginis, tens of thousands of them, and those days in the 12th century.  And so we come from quite an outrageous tradition. And this is because Mahamudra takes it really seriously this point, that Samshara and Yervana are different perspectives of the same word. 1 is the present perspective, the non-liberated perspective.  This is called samsara, who has always me in the center, me so important and the others. And then my relation with the rest of the world, always in terms of dualistic clinging and diversion. And that is the nirvana perspective happening in the same place. And it can happen in the same mind stream. The same mind stream can be in one situation in samsara. and then the next find  into this open way of being. That's called Nirvana, that's called Peace. So, Nirvana is not something to be attained somewhere else, but it is in the here and now. It doesn't wait for after death, it is here and now. And actually, it is, then you might say, wow, what a development of the Dharma. No, no, actually, the claim of my mother is that this is how the Buddha was able to teach.  45 years. Whatever situation he encountered, he was in this non-clinging mode. He was never losing this awareness of just how it is. So it is basically doing what the Buddha did and And serving people, serving all kinds of situations and not putting an end.  to this by saying, no, no, I will never come back to, for me, some Sada is finished. Hopefully some Sada is finished, then we talk about the art of coming back without being caught up in some Sada again. So that is a big learning process. How to enter a womb, how to be born, how to grow up and to again manifest that realization, that awakening. That's not so easy. you  That is behind the obvious activity in this world. There is a long-term perspective that the Buddha said, we, the Buddha said, we are also willing to learn that, how to manifest again and again. In this world where there is so much suffering. So I wanted to give you this first overview.  and then explain to you that there is basically three kinds of Mahamudra approaches. Sutra Mahamudra, Tantra Mahamudra and Essence Mahamudra. Three terms, good to remember, I will give an explanation for each one. Sutra Mahamudra is the teaching that we will mostly follow here. It is a step by step approach.  where you know you do practices that build upon each other. It's a gradual path. It's the progressive teaching on how to enter liberation and awakening. And it is called sutra-mahamudra because it is based on the mahyayana sutras. Like for example, some radiologists, sutras or the Lankava-toddhas, sutras and so on. You know, there are Mahayana Sutras with...  teach this basic approach and you know you know the small heart sutra which is one of the starting points for that and then the other planet parameters sutras. So all of that is forming the basis for this approach. And then so what you need to note maybe it's for those taking notes sutra mahamurra means a a gradual approach to Muhammad, based on the sutras.  And we have Tantra Mahamudra, which is based on the Tantras. Now in the Tantras, the Buddha manifested in form of bodies of light, different bodies of light. As the medicine Buddha, or as he don't like Vajrayogini and Chakra-Sambhwara, And there's lots of different manifestations.  And in these visions received by practitioners of the Mahamudra, then these meditation Buddhas were talking to the practitioner. And this was such an overwhelming experience, they were talking and they were showing the past, that the practitioners themselves, usually in that experience, they experienced an awakening. Take experience too.  completely liberating experience, which changed their lives, and they passed on, they talked about this experience to others. And then the vision, the vision of the original Tantric vision, which was like meeting the Buddha in person, but in the form of light, then this became what are the tantric visualizations. So if we visualize nowadays a tada of...  or the Chenvizig Amulukitesh, rather, or Manjushri. And so on, this all goes back to visions, original visions, which were then communicated. And the idea is to enter into this world of perceiving reality differently. This is entering, you can say, a Nialvanic perspective of life. The Tantric perspective has...  a little gradual approach, but basically it is an affirmation of each one of us having Buddha nature. Then you have Buddha nature, if you don't, if you have a little trust and you don't know how to do it, visualize yourself as Tana and you will come closer to who you really are. Yeah, this is kind of the, you receive a practice, a tantric practice where you visualize yourself as an awakened Buddha,  And you work with that to enhance that trust, that confidence in your own, but an HR. So it is supposed to be a very quick path because of always using this self image, which is a non-self actually. Yeah, we are connecting to ourselves as being an awakened presence. and we have the possibility to do this with different visualisation.  mantras, we are learning to perform activities, tantras are very much about activity. Okay, that's the tantric approach. This tantra maha-mooda is practicing maha-mooda with the help of these tantras, which were also written down and became the Buddhist tantric collection, I had a collection of tantras. So this we are not using here in the retreat. Okay, this This has spent a lot of my life.  with that, practicing that, and I'm teaching that, and other circumstances, but this is not the point here. But we will have times where we, like I already did, it comes spontaneously, it just happens, where we share something like Essence Mahmoudra. Now Essence Mahmoudra, This is absolutely not gradual, it's the instantaneous approach in the essence.  Now Mooda, awakening is not to be reached, it is here. It is from the now perspective. It is where the nature of reality is communicated as it is now. And either you get it or you don't get it. We say in Tibetan, either it's Marekpa, Ignorance or it's Rigpa, it's awareness, non-Jule awareness. This is Essence Mahmoudat's also the same.  as Mah\u0101r\u0101ti, which is the highest doctrine teaching. So we are talking about that. And in essence, Mah\u0101mura, there is no past to go. We are not talking about different levels, different yogas, and step-by-step and so on. We only talk about now. How is awareness? That's all. How is it? up  And if you can get that, and you don't have to do the gradual approach. But since we mostly don't get it, we better do the gradual approach. So that's why the gradual Sutra Mahal Mahal Mahal Mahal Mahal Mahal Mahal Mahal is the one which is most taught. Then of course Tibetans, they were all practicing tantra. You don't find it Tibetan practicing just the Sutra Mahal Mahal Mahal Mahal Mahal Mahal. It's very rare. This...  This is such a fallen world to us. It resembles a weak pantheon. When you look at it from the outside, so many days and you think, what's going on here? In which world have I ended up? What is happening? Did you ever enter a Tibetan temple? Then you know what I'm talking about. So, gradually I have entered that world. Yes, I'm very familiar with that. and I can't...  understand this world now from within. But the whole idea of all three approaches of Mahamudra is to realize that liberation is no, no where else. For the step by step, the progressive approach is the same. Awakening cannot happen in the future. It's clear, awakening happens, always, now.  The future is not something that exists, awakening also, cannot be lived in the past, if I was awakened yesterday, does not count today. Only counts whether the awareness is there or not. Past awakening is done count, future awakening is done count, and the present awakening is not something you can grasp onto. It's not an object of percept.  It is a quality of how perceiving happens is the quality of being in the world, not something that can be attained. So it is that very dynamic state of awareness without a center, that is Mahamudra. This dynamic dimension of awareness is that spacious quality, that dynamic quality, the receptive.  and the active aspect, all of that. That which made it possible for the Buddha and all the other awakened ones to live in this world and to communicate, that's meant by Muhammad. It's also called the Great Perfection, Zokchan, it's another name for that. Okay, so this was to give you a little idea of what could be in Mahamud.  And if you ask me, and then Vipassana, how does that relate? Well, that is Vipassana. That is actually what Vipassana clear seeing is all about. It is the experience of continuously being in that clear seeing, in the Vipassana experience, the Vipassana realization. You can continuously be in that.  This is Mahamudra. It's not something new. It's not something new that was that falling from the sky or what's invented. It's just taking it to its limits. That's all. Taking it so far that it becomes of real use in very challenging situations. Serving all sentient beings. I mean, if you try to serve all sentient beings...  You are in trouble. Here, it's clear. It's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not,  great capacity for somehow entering collisions, afflictions. Wow, they are so skilled on that. You know, there's one moment of opening, you don't look already, they have a new collision. It's so quick. I think it's amazing. And from the Enlightened perspective, I'm not enlightened. No, I'm just talking like this. Yeah, this is...  This is from the awakened perspective. You can just see the miracle of creative mind. You know, it's incredible. The creative mind, how fantastically creative it is to always create trouble. Wow, peace would be so easy. It would be so easy. Just a little bit more flexibility and we would all be at peace. Just less self-concern and we could all share this.  world and the animals would even be happy as at the same time. Wow, it could be so easy. Just a little bit less important to oneself. I'm not talking about an enlightened world, although it sounds like that. No, no, just a little bit less of that, a little bit enlightened, You know, a little bit. Wow. And I understand all...  religions as attempts to help us get there. That was the original idea. Here's the original idea was to come to a piece, a freedom of the hard mind. That is the common idea of all great people on this. Outside the religions as well of all those who are really gone deeply. So this would be for me the one Dharma approach.  To see that what I have taught you about Mahmoudra is actually for me, that which connects all the different approaches. If it is Allah or Yahweh or if it is God or if it is Tao and the Taoist tradition, you know Brahma, the, the Advaita tradition, and so on. If you name it and you get it, it's always that essence we are talking about. Now  and to live in that understanding. This is where this Buddhist powers also wishes to take us. Now, this was a free talk and I have to check the clock. How much time do I have left? 15 minutes, well that sounds good for meditation, right?  I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table. I'm sorry.  If you feel an inspiration from what you have heard before, the easiest way to meditate now is to sit in that inspiration. And to not even think about it more just to feel it, to feel the truth that you could understand And then the seat was that too.  to open after that. And to help with that, let us go again with feeling, feeling how simple it is to be. Please.  thing happens by itself, the heartbeat is by itself. All these physical functions we don't have to take care of them. And astonishingly enough, the mind is aware by itself. It is It's normal function to be aware.  And it is open by itself. If there is no movement narrowing it down, fixing on something, my end is wide over. you  Always experiencing. Experience of life never stops. Continuous by its own.  you  We now need to do anything to make the mind any better. It's clear by itself, aware by itself. The next experiences of now arise by themselves. then live up.  by themselves. Allow yourself to open up to that.  to relax into it. Just don't follow the normal relaxation process where you fall asleep, but it's relaxing into wakefulness. This is something to learn in Mahamudra. to relax into the awake state.  Yeah.  you  you  you  I'm going to do it.  you  you  I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

    "40.mp3": " I wish you a very good morning. And, if you're ready, let's allow the refuge to once again melt into ourselves. When we take refuge in the  Ma Muida tradition, we usually combine it with imagining that we are sitting in the presence of the refuge. So Tata could be appearing in front of us. on the Buddha, our idea of both of them.  We could be sitting in the middle of the Sangha. We could also, in a completely open way, connect to all the awakened ones that have ever been who are now and that might be in the future. We can connect to this open dimension, this awakened dimension. and then...  Our creative mind likes to give symbols. So it could be a lotus flower, it could be any flower, it could be a light, it could be just whatever comes to your mind. And then the Mahmouda tradition often we use the image of  A Buddha, blue like the sky. This Buddha never existed. This Buddha, Vajadada, is blue like the sky after the monsoon rains in India. And late in the year when the rains have washed clear the sky. and you're looking to  you look away from the sun into the deep blue and you can kind of feel the limitless expense of the universe. And this Buddha is kind of the primordial aspect of awakening that  that which the Buddha was pointing to, look, don't renovate this body, go directly towards Bodhi, the awakening itself. So, that connect directly with that. This is the true refuge. And many masters have said, well as an initial understanding space is really the best.  image to communicate the ungraspable. So we relate to that ungraspable, open dimension, and we know that it has all the qualities that we have been talking about. And that's why this blue Buddha of Light radiates with all the colors. Oh.  say rainbow colors which means all colors and which means all the qualities, all the dharma's of the Buddha which means the qualities of awakening. And this, we can say, this presence Is that which unites all Buddhas? That which is the common...  hard mind of all Buddhas, of all awakened ones, no matter which tradition. And even outside tradition doesn't matter, all awakened ones, they have realized this mind without a center but full of qualities. And although it seems so far away, Okay, then.  as we take refuge, we go for refuge, we direct our mind towards that. We say it three times and at the end of that, then this powerful presence dissolves into us. So there's a process of allowing it to become only light and allowing that light with all it.  blessing, with all its encouragement to dissolve into us and then just feel it, just be it and no comment, nothing, just allowing that to happen. If you feel like that you can join me and doing that while we say the triple refuge. Namah brinda!  Namodama namo sangha namouda namodama namo sangha namo Buddha namodama namo sangha  And with this, the practice begins. After that little moment of just being natural, usually discursive mind comes back, can we present and we thought in the understanding.  that awakening is not separate from us.  And those who love to play with their minds, you can imagine that blue space to be all of your awareness and wealth of qualities to be known.  and you also see everyone adds coming to your mind with that same quality of being awakened. Nobody is different from us.  There is this sense of breathing together with all living beings, with all of life. Thank you.  you  I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

But we can of course also return to the visualization of the Buddha and you to visualize this presence in your own heart and stabilize  as your Shama-tap practice. With the visualization in the center of your being, You could also visualize outside.  If your mind is already calm, you can let it rest in those qualities. little support you can give to it in order to be able to stay.  there is to just encourage it to find that open spacious quality of being.

Nothing inherently agreeable, disagreeable.  And thanks to seeing the directly, seeing the equality of phenomena in their true nature, no grasping.

    "4.mp3": " Let us start with a contemplation which is very helpful to begin the day. This usually called the contemplation of our precious human existence. But let me give you an example of what it means. old Tibetan yogi with Yusli.  when finished drinking in the evening, would wipe his cup, dry it, put it upside down next to his practice place where he would also sleep. And then waking up in the morning, or another day, and he would try to cup up for a little something to drink and start the day by contemplating just  What a fantastic gift this is to be able to practice yet another day, because it is not given that throughout the whole night, after every out breath there is an in-breath. It is not necessarily the case. this morning it seems we are all back together again.  which is good news. You can be breathed in and breath out. Giving our mind a direction that will allow it to start the day with gratitude.  Have a little look together with me. What in this world, which is in many ways, upside down, our aspects that generate the feeling of thankfulness of gratitude in our mind.

The body is okay enough to support this life. We have water. you  And it would be a custom and it is a patent tradition. A custom which I follow every day to find many reasons to be thankful.

And then let's come back to this meditation with the open senses. Yes, so you're welcome, those who are comfortable with it to try a little bit with open eyes. You know, probably a little bit downwards in front.  of you, maybe your eyes, your gaze, thoughts on the back of your neighbor, that's completely okay. Don't have to search for a special place. And opening up to the light. Very important if one is drowsy. Opening up to the outer line it so that the  Rightness of mind is stimulated. Opening up to the Heading Experience. Okay. Okay.  Not only the ventilation, the air conditioning, but there are so many small sounds. Be aware of all of what is going on in that area, in that field. And then the physical experience of being here.  Sit a little bit like, um, ready, ready for what is there, ready for the present moment, ready for what comes next. little bit, I can say we would use the word tonus in our length.  which bringing in an energy into your body that's straightens it up. Maybe some of you you like films with samurai, you know, like that sitting there and meditating samurai. Knowing that okay, unforeseen things can come from all directions and you just raise the tone or say a little bit.  Of course we are completely safe here, it's fine. It's just this wakefulness. It's great wakefulness, failed in the body, and failed in the senses. And there is a wakefulness in the mental field as well.  Breathing in and breathing out, we feel the whole body breathing in and breathing out. that isn't awareness of all of what is going on.  in the mind. Low censorship. All of these movements are allowed to be and that is the spaciousness which allows them also to flow on.  So, in the same way as we can hear the silence when we hear sounds, we feel the space as we notice the movements in mind. The spaces are always there.  It allows for the next movement to arise and the next and the next. And the art is soaring into that space.  And draw asiness comes back, look to the ceiling, open your eyes wide. to straighten your body and also  you will feel that there are too much away, that there is tension and restlessness, then you relax more. Then it's very fine to close the eyes and to say yes, I'm fully awake, I just need to calm down a little bit. I'm sorry.

With all the traces of our karma, that what we have lived and far and done in the past, And  offering support to ourselves, to live with all of that, to deal with it in a good way, to let it dissolve and to actually unveil our Buddha nature.  you  See your own potential, feel, taste your own potential. soft clarity.  moments of love. So out there even if in between clouds pass. It's exactly those clouds that you breathe in.  that we open up to. to  Take in that support, take in that encouragement. Imagine that even the Buddha will give you encouragement. Yes, my dear, go for it. You are my daughter, my son.  Trust your own capacity, trust your mind, whatever arises this heart's spread. And we have  Well established, this breathing in compassionately, the space of self-liberation, breathing out with care, supporting, and then actually opening up,  to some glimpses of our own Buddha nature. Some intuition that I can be so free, so will full of qualities. Then when that is established,  We can choose a situation where someone was a little disagreeable with us, challenging. Don't go to the worst situation. Perhaps going to a situation where you got a little angry... ...upset.  Not feeling understood.  And I'm breathing in except yourself being angry. Accept that anger. you  Breathing in all those uncomfortable feelings. And every time at the turning point, breathing into the heart, let go.  Then give yourself the support that you would have liked in that situation or that you would like now if you were to experience this situation again. to be connected with your Buddha nature when another person.  person behaves in a challenging way. How to be clear, how maybe not to enter the game, how perhaps to protect yourself,  Feel that strength. And at the same time feel that you understand your reaction. And again prepare yourself for the similar design.  your Asian, accepting your irritation, letting it dissolve, and supporting yourself and perhaps taking a few breaths before you react.  Taking some time to connect with your qualities before your acts react.  you  So what we are doing in this first step of working with challenging situations, we completely accept our normal reactions to this. How disappointed we might be, how angry we might become. Maybe my twig act was pried.  And we offer ourselves the support to feel, to reconnect with our qualities, the deeper qualities.  The capacity to remain inwardly warm, capacity to be understanding with our serves and with the other press.  Just to understand what is going on. Not following automatic reactions breathing in. The space of self-liberation. The Buddha in our heart. the way.  the love of the Buddha flowing into us, flowing into this situation. Okay, let's take a little pause here. Just relax from this.  This first part of the work. Let's see you doing it already, moving a little, opening the eyes. We are working with imagination. It's a good one.  trying to remember that our world is made of imagination. Even when we have the eyes open, the way we put our world together, Hope we look at people.  we feel this place, it's our own personal interpretation. Just imagine that maybe some of your family who doesn't like what you are doing is stepping into this room, how angry that person could become, that seeing us sitting here wasting all the time.  Or you could do so much good in the world. Let's see, you smiling. I hear some of you laughing. Yes. That's the one, that's a different way of seeing, seeing the same situation. you  So You might be trapped.  trying to do your best and actually doing your best. Like perhaps here in retreat, and another person sees you or hears of what you are doing. And gets so angry. What are you doing? of betraying our family.  of a culture. I have lived this. I have been through this. So then when you're ready, we will go for the second part of the story. Okay?  If you were Breath in the pause And you might choose such a situation now where you were doing your best And someone got mad at you angry I'm pretty sure it happened to us.  of us. If you're a parent, it definitely happened. If you're a school teacher, it definitely happened. If you're a Dharma teacher, it definitely happened. If you had tried to do some good in this world, which was a little bit unusual, then it has happened.  And you might have been surprised at the react. But now take one situation. Okay? Take one. Only one. Remember one situation. you were surprised by the angle of the other person.  Continue building in and building art. And freeze the situation, that means don't make it into a movie. It is just a photo. It's just a photo room.  Remembering that you don't allow it to move and to become a big scenario again. None of. So it's the distant memory. And actually, we can make it quite small. If you look at the photo, you can make it that small. Thank you.  that it is not overwhelming. And to breathe with it, you remember again your own reaction and to breathe in your own react.  acknowledging it, acknowledging perhaps the incapacity to handle that situation or the limitations. And that's all you need to do. There is this space of self-loving. That's always the place where we can relax.  And the understanding remains. The understanding, oh yes, I reacted like this. Maybe I would have needed this kind of support. And that's the support we sent. Now we do the same thing for the...  angry person. Getting so angry. First of all we accept the anger. Okay, breathing in. Yeah. If you feel that something gets dynamic there, make it back into a hole.  Make it back into a photo. imprint in your mind.  Let go of the photo if you need, so I'll bring it back just let it dissolve into light. This is the self liberation, not only of what you failed the moment you connected with, but also of the situation.  you  you  We are in the pause and only those of you who wish to continue. You can try again looking at something at this situation. We are accepting a part of some sada.  So sad is not a beautiful place to be. So much suffering. And somewhere, become so angry, there is suffering.  And again, let it dissolve. Let it dissolve again. This is the capacity you need to let it dissolve and it's time. If you need help, you'll open your eyes. You make a paw.  in that sphere of self-loving. You come back to your own qualities, your own Buddha nature.  I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page.

I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to put it on.  you  We are sitting in our Buddha nature. The important thing is that we don't lose contact with those basic qualities. When we let images, memories arise.  I'm going to go to the next slide.  you  We will not go on the right side. We will not go  further this time. Invite you into entering your mind, your attention, your imagination, to something really agreeable. Could be sufficient to look around in this room. Oh, too bad.  And to imagine to sit in a place with people you love, or in a place where you love to be alone.  Maybe to have a little cat lying on your lap.  All of this is working with our creative mind. Let's finish this little exercise by remembering, wow.  What a dream! I will use a few minutes to talk about this. I'll give you a little better understanding. You are beginning to get to know.  a method that works with, let's call it the pre-consciousness. Unconscious sub-conscious is not quite the right word. The moment we open up to something challenging, we are not completely in control of what arises. want to control it, pen.  There's a possibility that really heavy stuff suddenly comes to the surface. And we have to be able to let it dissolve again. Okay? This is what happens to people in dream at night. This is the mechanism of nightmares.  less control, no control at night, and then from the unconscious, the pre-conscious, then images arise. This is what is so difficult when people relax, because to relax also it's always meant to relax control. or to make this save this exercise where we relax and we...  even invite is that we need to have control. We need to master that letting go, putting limits, reducing the impact, making it small or even allowing it to dissolve, placing our attention somewhere else, going towards what is awesome. We need that capacity. Okay?  Otherwise, it's too strong, then we might very quickly be overwhelmed. So the capacity that we develop in Shamata to direct our attention, which has an element of control, but is very much needed here. We need the capacity to direct our attention in a way that is really helpful.  And we need the capacity to open up, because all those imprints, they are active in us. However, they are under the lid. You know, lid to understand is like, Merci. That's it. And under the lid, This is what then recall  unconscious then it is active there and it influences our way of dealing with the world. Now there's many lids are made from glass so that you can look in. And this is a little bit the effect of practice. We can feel and see a little bit what is waiting there at least where it's close to the surface. Yeah, we can see that.  That's what I call pre-conscious. When we are relaxed enough and we dare to look, we begin to see. And of course, there is a wish to open the lid. OK? But only shortly. Only shortly, and then the capacity to close again. So in a way that is limited.  Not free access, not a lot of it boiling over. Now the way the example goes, we think there is something solid boiling. No, no. All of these are forces, these are energies. And the only power they have is to...  create experiences in the mind. So whatever these forces have in power is only the power to bring false feelings, images, you know, yeah, that's what they do actually. They don't bring false so many concepts like words and so on, sometimes yes, but normally not, it's much more are you saying basic images  smells, smells, feelings, the other reactions that go with it, the emotions that go with it. So that's why we need this deep insight into the called empty nature, the insubstantian nature of what is coming up. inside.  needs to accompany the practice. And sufficient, not realization, not we are not talking, but waiting until we have kind of reached the super realization, but sufficient enough to help us to find it a relaxation. Just like a person, when waking up in the morning, the dream is still kind of present, and at that moment the person notices, or just...  the dream and then there is a letting go of the dream. Not like people very often who then attach more meaning to the dream, not like this. Oh, it's just the dream. Okay, let's continue this kind of understanding. Okay, this is what is needed here.  I hope we got all the little clothes.  and fill your normal breathing for your body.  So I encourage all of you to only do that practice when you are doing this. practice when you...  really want to do it, you got a little taste of it, but otherwise I invite you to sit on the lid. Okay? To be sure. Okay? This is one part of our freedom. We know how to deal with the mind, Let me say no, okay, this is enough.  more of that. Every weight, maybe never, anyhow. It doesn't have substance. It's not that it really has the strength to do something. But yes, I know it influences me in a subtle way. I'm okay with that, but I'm okay not to do more right now. So it's a very healthy way of dealing with this.  Only when you feel that there is, you feel at ease and you feel stable then, you might want to open a little bit, not much, in a very controlled way, and let it dissolve. Basically, it's steam. It's steam. Steam is energy, incredibly strong energy.  steam engines, you know, strong energy, but it's only steam. It evaporates. There's something nice about steam since I am with this image, which I've never used before, but steam it can evaporate but they can also be condensation.  And that's water then, and that water becomes cool, and that's the compass. That's the compass on which arises from the practice. The heat of the emotions is gone, and the understanding which remains is the wonderful, You're most sending your mid-ifang quality of compass.  I had a lot of steam in my system, I tell you. I was quite short-tempered as a young man. I do less than.  So, may I be happy? So, may I be happy?  May they have the causes of happiness. May we all be free from suffering, and may we all have causes to be free from that. May we enjoy that deep joy, that freedom, and may we live in the great equanimity, It's just a...  result of deep understanding.  you",
    "43.mp3": " The way to take refuge, to go for refuge, can be informal. The auto forms, the recitations are simply a shortcut for those who have gone the informal way many times and they don't want to use many concepts. So, this is Namibudan Namibudan.  Dhamma, Amazanga, shortcut. But if I take you a little bit longer away, slightly longer only, slightly. Then as I sit down here, I see the beauty of the Dhamma. of a beauty.  of how to say of the words of the transmission, and then the beauty of that liberation which they point to these words, these images. And I know from my experience and understanding this is all...  already going for refuge in the Dharma to see its beauty. I was sitting down and sentences from a satan I came to my mind, all beautiful, holy Dharma. It is improper to doubt it. And so on, yes, it's like a recitation. But then I...  contemplated for a moment. What does it mean? They are always contemplated, what does it mean? There is the beauty, there is again the wonder, the amazement. Or that would be my AIDS parameter. You know, that would be the next one we would declare to be a transcendent quality. And then the taste.  of what is the transmission of Dharma beyond the words. And as we taste that, as we intuitively taste, that we are already in it. And then if you want to make it a little bit more complete, if there is any need for that, How beautiful the Buddha, the beauty, none of that man.  Yes, man, he has very good, no one knows him. Yes, no one has seen him. He is depicted with all this bluish hair on his head, but he was running around chasing all the time. He didn't even wear hair. We have an image of him, which is actually the beauty of connecting to that. you  which might go back to a man who has left those traces. Maybe these are the traces of Cidata. Maybe these are the traces of this Gautama Buddha. Maybe, but actually who cares? It's the beauty of the Buddha in the sense of the beauty of those qualities.  that are communicated through the example, through those texts which describe his questions and answers. The beauty of the lineage of those, we are followed in his footsteps and then we are with the beauty of the Sangha, the beauty of those who really  live in friendship with all beings and who care to share the Dharma, to share those qualities, to share that liberating understanding. So, I hope I could take you in this informal way a little bit into the refuge.  I do have the wish that you take that home with you. I would really love it if you find your form, and your informal ways to open your practice by seeing what is meant by the three drowards and being able to take that as your  reference, your guidance, in a non-sectarian way. Means we are not becoming a partisan of Buddhism. That's not what it is about. That's what I mean by not adhering towards and concepts, but towards behind. This is it.  down. I thought yes the time has come to talk to you a little bit because of preparing the next days, a little bit about the meaning of life, which is a super topic. Haven't we been talking about it all along? Haven't we already But the dealt with it sufficiently? Yes?  Look, I have been looking into your eyes so often, all the eyes I could look into, I was looking into. And I know you are going in so many diverse situations. Some are going into self-retreat, some are working with people in telebil mental states, my growing was their families some of our jobs.  and take care of the sun and then some. Now all of this is happening. Some are going to teach the next retreat, for example. And we are on these different states. Now what is the common denominator for all of us when we leave from here? What is the one thing that will make sense to everybody? That is one.  is to see the meaning of what we are doing, the meaning to give meaning to what we are living. Now you can imagine that many people have tried to talk with me about the meaning of life and some are desperate of having lost it and some never found it. and uh... did I say that it's...  simple answer. We give meaning to life. Don't try to find it. Yes, every wise person knows that to look for meaning in life, where do we look? Do we look into the cruel aspect of life? Or we look at the beautiful aspect of life? Do we play the two against each other? that's life.  Have a meaning? We can search long. We can ask Mother Nature whether there is a meaning to all of that which is happening. We can ask humanity, we can ask God. I tell you there is a shorter way than searching and searching and being disappointed by contradicting answers. Give meaning to your life to it yourself.  Give that meaning to your life that you find the most inspiring. We cannot change our lives so much. We cannot change this body. It's the body we have been born in. We cannot change our DNA. That's the genes we are born with. We cannot change so many things. but we can give me...  meaning to all of that which we cannot sense and to all of that which we can sense. And it can be the same meaning. To turn it, to use it as a source of inspiration. And you tell yourself, you see for yourself, what is inspiring? It's not up to me to tell you. again if you have little idea about  this beautiful holy Dharma, you know, and the rest. But this is just again, it's just a big word, because Dharma doesn't only mean teaching, Dharma means qualities, and which qualities are really the ones that you wish to live in your life. I will make a little jump towards the end of our life when we leave this body. For the time will come. Nobody knows where.  Hopefully, we all reach home safely when we leave here tomorrow. Hopefully, maybe it's already the time to leave this body, who knows. But when the time is that we will go beyond, as there are some of us or friends now in the process of...  dying due to different, your sickness, illness, wounded and so on. And many people are dying constantly. Then how to die without regret? And the simple answer is a person who has lived that which is truly and spiting to him, I.  whenever I have regret. So let's not be like, you know, say these are the qualities we want to live and what we actually live is just a little bit touching on those qualities, but mostly to the side of it, then the feeling is of partially missing out in life, a partially regretful life, which is very common.  situation for people. Yes, to some extent my life resembles me, but then there is so much, which does not resemble me. Right? It is, and why? And the answer is not because what we do there is not me, it is more how we do it. Okay? We haven't been able to give meaning to that, 5  If we cannot give meaning to that, we have not been able to change it. So that it corresponds really with the qualities that we wish to live. So if you become pregnant, for example, or you, also as a man, you become a father. Mother as a child. Okay, there's nothing to discuss about that. I'm sorry.  And this needs to be combined with those inspiring qualities that we need to live in this life. That is exactly what we are going to do. If you go to school and you teach, you go unfortunately to the military. or wherever you go, somewhere where you might not even want to...  be. Maybe you have to work as a cook and McDonald's or something. You know? Yes, then, yes, could be amazing, could be amazing. If we manage to take that into practice. If we manage to live those qualities.  in that situation. I've been working with prison guards, people working as the guardians of the prison, but I'm also in deep contact with someone living life-song, lifelong sentence in prison, being the one that is guarded. They can all practice the Dharma.  The way is only how to do that. And this now you will, if you can take this as your daily practice. You think often that your daily practice needs to be, maybe to calm your mind and to develop inside. I agree, that's very important. But it is more important to give meaning to your life. But that is there.  then the practice of Shammata and Vibhasa Navi will follow. Give meaning, that is the thing that we're really, and of course a calm peace for mind and insight are the qualities you want to live, then you're very much in the air day of what needs to be done in your practice. first when you go now into your situation set home.  And the most important is when you look forward, because you don't apply the six Dhammas of Tilapa at that point, you look, you anticipate the future. This is part of it. You anticipate what will be coming up during the day for you. And already in your meditation, contemplation of the morning, you see yourself living the qualities of Dharma that which is most inspiring to you.  in those situations that are pretty sure to come up for you. So you prepare yourself. You open the path. You see exactly how you will be cleaning up the mess of others. And you do it with the inner quality that you wish to live there. You see how you have to maybe hire or fire somebody. Very unpleasant things. will do it with the call.  that you wish to live. You will probably be listening to the news or seeing the news, and you will do it with the attitude that you want to manifest, that you want to live. You don't go like someone blown by the winds of kamik reactions. You prepare yourselves that whatever you do, and of course, beginning all of that is too much, you prepare just one.  situation and then you try and you prepare the next situation, like you will stand, no, you have vacation now, but then if you prepare like standing in front of one of your classes, not of all of them, because maybe they are difficult and then you will prepare yourself about how doing that. And then since you do it every day, you begin to get a feeling of how you live the various situations in your life with...  repeat. And you also begin to prepare for the unforeseen. Now you open up to all of that, you welcome it, and you begin to feel the inner attitude with which you want to be present in that situation. And this is how you really actively then shape your life. You feel first, that which you want to live.  And of course we could do an exercise about that, but actually it means pretty much like taking a notebook, you know, and contemplating and writing down what is most important to you. And it's very good instead of using nouns to use adjectives or adverbs, they're more dynamic, like joyful instead of joy.  or simple instead of simplicity or authentic, instead of authenticity, always the adjective or the adverb is more speaking. We can see ourselves more in it. It is not a program of how we need to become. It's more equality that we want to discover. So, you take time, you write down those which  come up first. And it might take a few days. You come back again and again, Drew. You know, how you want to look back on your life, in order not to have regret and to be really thankful for this life. Like, yes, when I die, I would like to look back and have lived this life with a lot of love. Yes? Oh  a good sense of humor, in this sense, lightness, humorous. Like you think in your own ways, you don't only use the books for the words from the Dharma books. This is where we have the whole. You have the whole panorama of possibilities. Some of you come up with creative others they will say.  and then one person says down to earth. You know what you mean with that. I had one person when we were doing this exercise, she wrote down wild. She wanted to be wild. She knew exactly what that meant. And for her, it was much better than to say freedom. freedom, freedom to be free, didn't mean the man thing.  and the wild had a much stronger power. And it wasn't a wild, respectful, you know, wild. It was, she knew exactly, or for me, a long time it was dancing, yeah? And maybe an image comes, an image where you see yourself living those qualities. an image where you  which kind of symbolizes a lot of those qualities. So for me, for example, I didn't have such an easy childhood. So for a long time, my guiding image was seeing me as a boy in the sun running across the green metal jumping light. You know, like a little bit like dancing, but more this running style jumping. And that was...  for me, so expressive. If you try to put that into words, it's a little bit clumsy, but the image talks to you. And then another image, which was very important, just to give your ideas where you can look. Another image was that I was an animal. You know, this animal living and the mountains with these horns, which go like this.  like this, move long and French, I don't know what is there. Huh? Yes, something like this. And I've met them and they sit on the top of the rocks in the mountains. And they're just sitting, I don't know what they're doing, but I can really feel that this is how I want to be sitting there quietly up in the wilderness. and looking down, you know, seeing all the business  be low, not being touched by it. You know, another image like this. So just to give you ideas, I could go on and on, but I don't want to fill your head with my stories, but the thing is, be creative about how you describe to yourself what is the meaning of your life, and then see how you can live that.  Daily. Make your life. This by daily taking care that it goes in that direction, that there is a little bit more of that. A little bit more. Another image for me was the Lions Raw. The Lions Raw. That was at the time when I was student and there was working on the psychosomatic clinic and  and that it is scream therapy, you know, incredible. Yes, but not the Janov style, but what was it? Casper style, what is it? And this hugging type, the bonding type. And I discovered my fearful self discovered the power of the raw. And it became wonderful liberating for me. So if I think about it now, of course, I don't have to practice the lines wrong.  anymore. But it has been there for a while. And that's why I tell you those images, they don't have to be good for all life. They are good for this phase in life. And they will change. They will change by themselves. They will fall away when they are not needed anymore. And if I listen to my own frail voice, when I think with you, the Almighty being my a home to the nation.  guy is getting old, there's no lines, rather, but it's fine. I listen to my own sensitivity and maybe to be sensitive, to be, to be in resonance is one of the qualities I like to live. You know, it's like you find out for yourself and then you have a list of these qualities in your notebook and then you underline the  three most important ones, because a long list is too much. You look at them and you see which ones really speak to you most and you underline them. And you try to remember them. And if something is missing, you add, or if something is not working, you change. But But like this, instead of having the triple refuge every day, Buddha Dhamma Sangha, which is  thoughts on three qualities. You have your triple quality refuge every day, which is like guiding stars in your day to remember. Okay? So that was my little teaching about the meaning of life.  Stretch your legs before we meditate a little bit.  I'm going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit  I'm a little bit in a playful mood. When I thought, now when I was drinking, what is the, you know, I was feeling like, what's the next meditation instruction? And I was asking you inwardly, ready? Study? Go! There is nowhere to go! I'm sorry.  We are too, we are too run too, no we are too run. Okay, let's sit on that.  you  I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm sorry.  I have received two notes asking questions. Asking  that do. Well, I know that some of you just don't like it so much. Some like, some don't. And what to do? What to do? You know, singing or liturgy or, you know, this ritual, you I wake up in the morning listening to a  you've not been in soft, soft pronunciation, and you know, yes, and then I, you know, it's time to get up, it's fine, it tells me it's good, but I know it's just the recording, I guess, is not up yet. But I just come from Greece, and it was the Orthodox chance. So most...  recordings. And they're not so different. The sound is very nice somehow, very nice. And then of course, I have my question upbringing, then I know those souls and chance. Then the Tibetans are chanting along and then I have been so commemorating two persons with a televised and you know wherever you go.  People are chanting. A part of the population all over the world loves chanting. And others, they love to be silent more of the time. And most important is that for many of us with this typical upbringing for us, whatever is chanting, it sounds like manipulation. There is a flare of being pulled into something and not being...  able to avoid it. Yes? And again, what to do? It's still beautiful and there's so much liberating, liberating the heart. It's like bringing the energies to flow. So we could chant in a liberating way without having to do it ever again. You know, now commitment. We only do it when we like it.  No commitment. It's like with the chanting of the refuge, you know, this namu buddha namu damas, just the shortest one. But if we are always doing it freely, on the time feels right. You see, sometimes I've been getting up even in the evening last session. I didn't do a dedication with you, except be happy or sleep well. But the dedication was there in my mind, but just...  Not necessary to follow a ritual, although a ritual is very comforting, it's very, hmm, gives a frame. But it's not the Buddhist path really to adhere to rituals, although they give this nice frame. So if we do it, we do it because we want to do it. So I will chant how many people home with you because you have not been chanting them.  very much, but you know, as we wish to relax and silence, please think that no one is noticing that you are not chanting. Or you can even already go out, it is really fine, it is really fine. Yes, it is absolutely very fine. I have been sitting, you know, I had three girlfriends, one of the other, the third one became my wife, they were all practicing Tibetan Buddhism, all three of them.  And I was into Vibhasaana, into silence. You don't believe how many chanting I was sitting through, without participating. They were so cool, some Baba. They were so cool to let me do. I was sitting there. And today, sometimes I jammed. So let's...  to it. That was for like.  Oh, my name is Mahu. Oh, my name is Mahu. Oh  Oh, my name is Mahu. Oh, my name is Mahu. Om  O Manebe Mahu, O Manebe Mahu, Oh man.  Oh, my name, oh, oh, my name, oh, oh, my name, oh, oh, my name, oh, oh, my name, oh, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh, my name, oh,  Oh my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name, Ramahumah, my name,  O my name be my home, O my name be my home.  Thank you.",
    "1.mp3": " I will be practicing my English on you. So, hello everybody, I feel so happy and blessed. We have Lama Tilman here with us. Welcome. Thank you very much. I will also practice my English. It's the first time that Lama Tilman is coming to Israel at all. and I just picked him up.  few hours ago from the airport and ever since we've been standing in the PKK which is one of the first words he learned in Hebrew. And it was Sababa. We had many hours. And we have Michali with us. Thank you so much for joining us and giving us a hand with the...  I don't want to hear your voice and say hello. I'll just say it afterwards. I want to start. I'll just say a few words about retreat and how we run retreats here in Israel. It's going to be new for Lama Tillman. so we can all remember and learn.  together. All of you are seasoned practitioners. All of you said quite a few retreats, so you know and you heard these talks before and just re-freshing our memories. Do you hear me well? It's okay, Yeah, no, no, better like this and at the back they have like big loudspeakers.  Good. Better? Yeah? Okay. So, maybe just a few moments of reminder, what are we doing here? Such a blessing to come out of this cooking pot and to what we call a retreat, to retreat from our everyday, usual mind to find it here. But maybe we defundize, maybe...  with different heart. I like to have the similarly of the C-shore, that in times of AB, goes back, the C goes back and then we can find and see what is there, what is there on the sand. Maybe it's one of the pictures of what might be possible on a retreat.  What can we see that is usually hidden after under heavy waters? But just as well as seeing what is there, the how-to, how do we see what we see is equally important, like the two wings of that bird, that famous bird, with compassion, with kindness, with softness. I'm just reminding all of us what we know and so easily.  forget to allow ourselves this space that is more soft, it is more accommodating. The bright eyes that are given to our inner world, the friendly eyes, the kind eyes. I want to say, especially in times like these.  but always, always, always. But maybe even more so now, it's many of us come from different backgrounds, some are directly influenced by the situation of war, others indirectly and still influenced, all of us are influenced. So even more so to practice, to study, to learn,  And to give ourselves this opportunity to go to the depth of the heart, what is possible for us as human beings, not just difficulties, not just pain, not just dukkha, also love, healing, also liberation.  So it's great that we are all here and we are all in it together because we support each other in that way. So I want to mention the sort of nice cushion of silence that we love to speak about on retreats, just a reminder, most of you know it by now, by heart maybe. But again, I would want to stress.  the softness that is made possible in the healing that is made possible when we are not engaged in our everyday activities and our everyday mind in the same way in which we think and rethink about ourselves, about others, about the world. And the silence can provide us the opportunity to first foresee it, and then maybe take a leap from there to a different  space. And we do it for oneself and we do it for others because I like to quote Tichnatan, often who said happiness is not a private matter and here we are, we're doing it together. And the other thing is a reminder about the setting, the setting of a retreat we sit on very ancient tradition.  coming from the Buddha and it's the first time that we have in Tovana, the kind of teaching the Tlamatil man is offering. The base is just the same and I'm talking about now the precepts. How can we live a life that would be with more ease, with more openness, with more trust, more care, with more wisdom, with more love.  So we try, we take a vow, maybe, to refrain from harming. It's as simple as that. And sometimes we see these small little ants walking, crawling on the path. And maybe one can reflect upon the fact that the same life is running through us and through this little tiny creature. What is, what do we have in common?  with all forms of life. We want to take into consideration our consumption. What do we take from the world? How much do we take from the world? Obviously not taking what is not freely given. This is the precept. How do we approach the material world? This is a big subject and we would not go into it now, but I'm just like, you know, showing.  bits and pieces to reflect upon. Consumersism, for example, how much do we participate in it? How much do we pay attention to what we say? Is it in alignment with our inner climate, with what we believe in, with our values? And here on the retreat I was just saying some...  but the silence and obviously there would not be much time or space for you to speak. It's a silent retreat and still and yet on the weekend we will have opportunities. Michal will speak about it in a minute to meet us or one or one and again. How much is our speech reflect what is true for us, what is valuable for us? and it goes just the same for...  our inner speech. What is the music that is being played when we talk to ourselves? Is it kind? Is it a kind music? Is it not kind? Just noticing that very lightly, maybe shifting from the unkind to the kind. This is already a very big shift, very big inwards shift. Just noticing our inner speech.  And taking care with our sexual energy, just taking care again, non-harming is the key. And we never know who sits next to us. We never know the sensitivities. And in a retreat especially, we just want to keep ourselves to ourselves. American historian Longfellow said, everyone you meet is fighting a battle, you know nothing about, be calm.  always. It goes for that too. So just keeping our energy to ourselves and taking care with maybe looking and so forth. And the fifth precept would be taking care with not using substances that are maybe obscuring the mind. When here on the retreat you don't have much opportunities. Still,  taking care with maybe too much coffee or Whatever you use to not be in touch with yourself because it's too painful. Maybe there is another way very gentle way and Something in the atmosphere of the retreat when we know it and we hold it together can serve that as well Seeing and letting go So I want to stop here and present.  Lamatilman, who very kindly agreed to come to Israel. It was few months back when was it in December or a little bit earlier. Late November that I had a good fortune to come to a Buddhist conference and from Buddhist teachers from Europe, I think mostly the world. except for the terrible thing.  just two weeks after. Wow. So we spoke in length and Stephen was there as well. And when we got to meet Lamatilman, both of us felt, I certainly can speak for myself, that I want this guy, this teacher to come to Israel and give his teaching to the Sangha, to us.  And somehow miraculously said yes. So thank you for that. And thank you especially big thanks for coming in times like this, which most foreign teachers, most teachers that are not from Israel actually didn't show up because it's really too much. Yeah, to come in a time like that. this. So, especially thank you for coming and I'm very very  curious and looking forward to hear and receive the teaching. La Matilde is going to convey here. Many years of being a monk, maybe you can say more about this. Yeah, maybe you say after. Yeah. Maybe Michalis, please continue. Thank you.  So I want to also welcome us all, and I'm very happy to be here. I just wanted maybe to offer a moment of gratitude, yeah, for Lila was talking about care and taking care of our environment and ourselves, maybe a moment of gratitude for coming here. for all the people.  and the conditions that allow us to sit here together, to take care of our minds and heart. As Lila said, it's not a private matter.  I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing.

I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to start with the first one.  I just wanted to add that this weekend we won't have groups and Lila and I will offer option to meet one to one. It would be on the board and you will see it. So this this will be for the weekend. It will change a little bit.  for whoever is staying for the whole 10 days. And I wish us all a very open, hearted and mind which reads, and may it be well and supportive. Thank you.  How much time do we have now? What is the cook's are waiting for us at which time? 10 minutes. 10 minutes?  When the time is short, meditate. Let's do that together. I will guide a little meditation with you. Like Mikhail was already starting. I will take you more about this person here later on. I enjoy being with you. and it is this joy that carries  me write him to the medities. And I encourage you, if you may, to breathe in with that gratitude that Mikhail mentioned, that we all made it here. that we will share this.  space together. And we may say thank you to ourselves. Thank you O Chab, dear lady, that you brought me here. This is the part of us who managed to...  overcome obstacles.

If it is something to let go, the out breath is always a wonderful symbol of just allowing that to flow out and then a little moment of opening at the end of the out breath.  And if you feel that there is something to open up to the in-breath is perfect for that. To open up into the situation, to open up into the feeling. And then there is the turning point at the end of the in-breath. where the opening up naturally goes.  over into this flowing on attitude, this letting it all flow on.  I don't know how tired you are, what is going on in your mind, but I do know that making space for it is really helpful. So as we breathe in, that is the space opening up. And as we breathe out, this is yet another...  another space opening up. And you might notice that we never leave that space.  you  A welcoming space is my teacher would say in the safe space and dynamic very much alive spacious awareness.  you  you  And maybe you already feel that this is quite simple.

So we don't let them wait.",
    "47.mp3": " Make yourself comfortable and let's see if there are some questions that have left. I've been left. Yes, please.  Now a jealousy, the one with the wind is jealousy. No, the one with the earth is the one with the pride. was not so clear on our drawing.  Yes, huh? Oh, no feelings there. How can someone go and bring me the drawing that we put in the feelings, the emotions? Yes. I go through and I will explain you a little bit more about that. I thought there were two Lotus and one was with the emotions, right?  Yes, of course. Wasn't there? Oh, same, same. Same, same, but different.  Any other question while we are waiting? Yes, please. Yes. Eating is fantastic. Yes, good Mahamudra meditation. Yes, choiceless awareness. It means that the Mahmouda is not so difficult.  from the Vipassana in that sense, because where the first is, you accept whatever is offered to you. This is the choiceless part. And then the additional part is that as you swallow it, you imagine that you nourish the Buddha inside of you. And maybe your brothers and talk about that.  because they have integrated a lot of teachings, but the you notice the timeless awareness, you notice that awareness of just how things are. And then if we go deeper, then actually the tastes, the tastes itself, like also healing and so on, but the taste is considered to be dark kidneys, little mess enters of  awareness. So every taste, like when it opens the taste in you, actually it opens the space of awareness and you practice like this. So up here and in the heart it's the Guru, the Buddha Guru is being nourished and it means that you nourish this body in order to nourish awakening.  Oh, come on, not in Israel, look, look you guys. In Israel the fire is not in the West, but it's all over. I'm sorry.  Look, the conception mind then tries to grasp. Now the idea is not that you learn this. This is not the idea. There has been a lot of grasping to this. You find this in different books and so on my God. If you read Govinda or someone like this then off we go into all kinds of  of concepts. And this is not the idea. The idea is that, oh yes, the problem is that the Hebrews from the right to the left and I get always, it's a solution, you say? Yes.  If I can have a pen or Lila, you take your pen and you do it and your own handwriting, you take a book to write on so that you have a support. So look, the message is one that Lila likes to call that. It is a teaching from our tradition to snatch.  the Jewel from the head of the snake. That's the message behind. Which means that you take the best out of the emotion that you can get before the snake bites you. Yes, the mental poisons. You can write them in small, like in the center. it would be eggnether, it's a leg of awareness eggnether.  fear, this would be like the center, yeah, it's the same. And now what happens is you cannot snatch, it's not like this, it is actually, it is each time, it is a surprise. Each time something very surprising happens. you open up into the nature of fear or the manifestation.  of ignorance, which are like dynast, sleepiness, cloudy, you know, when you are able to look into that, you discover a sphere of openness, which is the absolute contrary to what you thought, what you felt before, you felt so close in and so fearful, there was no space. So that what you discover when the  The fear is dissolved, actually, that's the spaciousness, that's the center. So this is netching the jewel of the true nature of fear and space. It's like before the fear bites you, you look into it and you discover this space. Yes, like this. This is kind of the short teaching. I have to make a short now. We are in a Q&A. We are not in a full teaching. you do.  the same process with anger, which will be here in the East, because for the Tibetans, now actually for the Indians, the East is always in front. It's not like the North for us, when the in the maps, you know, where we think the North is up. The East is where the sun rises, and this is where you look, and this is from where the world starts. So the East is always in front of you, and where you are is the center, and then if you turn to the right, since it's North and hemisphere it's the south.  And then if you turn to the left, it's the North. So that's how the Mandalai is arranged. So wherever you are, the agreement is in front of us is East. So in the East, on the better, there's anger. As in our impure vision and anger is the most stuck experience you can think of. Anger makes you blind, it makes you anger hatred, it makes you follow.  Beliantly a path of revenge and it makes you the most stubborn possible. It's like, it's the opposite of what we discover when we look into the anger, when there is the seeing into the anger. Now when it happened to me for the first time, it happened with my teacher, who lived in the furthest with me, one of the assistant teachers of Gennaro Npuchi. She was it.  of a different opinion than me, and because I was collecting a book for her and I got, you know, and I got upset at her and so on. And because I was angry, three, the mind had the habit of looking into what happens. And in the middle of this anger arising, the mind looked. And I burst out in laughter because I couldn't find the anger anymore. It was gone, but like that, I'm sorry.  So the surprise event, when you snatch the jewel here, when you snatch that, the surprise is that you find fluidity where before you will completely stuck. And suddenly you find a new flexibility and there's nothing more flexibility than a good sense of humor. So we were both laughing about the situation because she was anyhow flexible. I had become flexible again. Yes, I like this. There is the flexibility.  back. Okay, now we snatch the jewel of pride. Okay, we go to the south. Here in my Mandela when I looked like this is there for you it's on the other side. So there is nothing more unequal than the feelings of pride and arrogance and autiness and me the best me the superior me the most important. This creates all the unequal  in the world. And it makes always that my desires come first, my opinions count, not, you know, and when you look into the mental movement, it's a little bit difficult because pride is not so obvious to see, but when you look into that, wow, and again, an inner space opens, and then you realize nobody home. home.  Nobody there, the Me cannot even be found. And at that moment you also realize that's the same for everybody. We are all equal in the sense that everybody is trying to be so important, but nobody home, nobody there, big illusion. So we see through the empty nature of first of all the person, And then the same comes with all this judging of better.  and so in the outer world it comes with other phenomena as well. So the experience of equality is the surprising contrast to the previous experience of inequality. That one was thinking oneself to be superior, which is a great relief. The cure for us when we are proud and I talk from experience, yes, of course we have all five, But  is that slowly slowly we feel normal, we feel normal, nobody special. We don't feel inferior, we don't have to become the servant or the slave or something, this is just another form of arrogance. Actually we feel normal, we don't need to be someone special and actually we are no one. Then you know you have gone a long way with your pride.  these feelings come. So this is snatching the third jewel. Now we go to desire and you question about the fire. Don't think about the direction. It's just has to have a place so it's in the west. Maybe it's a setting sun, who knows? Yes. But the fire is of course the fire of desire. Okay, patterns like...  It burns. Yes, it's a very burning emotion. And in the desire, what happens is that we zoom in, we single in into what we want. And that becomes like the only focus. We want that woman, that man, we want...  that object, we want that kind of experience, that's a muddy, you know? And then this, actually this narrowing in, when we look into the desire, then, wow, what happens is that the illusion of this bringing me happiness is gone. There is no desire to be found nor is there the  the desire is object to be found, that illusion is gone, but what remains is an incredible capacity to appreciate the world. An incredible aliveness, and the aliveness is actually hidden in the desire. Only it is so much narrowed down that life seems to depend on having that what I want, but actually life doesn't depend at all on that.  So the surprise this company is, the diversity of life with all the capacities to differentiate, which are used and desired, but in a process of narrowing down. Now the capacities of differentiation are used, whether the free mind who sees the empty nature, to see the great variety of experiences, as very  fresh, vivid, new all the time. And then there is a deep appreciation which is coming from that. And that moves us into the fifth pattern, the fifth element, which is the wind element. You call it air, but better call it wind because here we have the active element of air. It's moving air, yes? Because now we are actually snatching the jewel of jealousy, right?  every competition and that other aspect of comparing in our world. And this is the dissatisfaction thinking that I don't have enough. And I compare, I think of how it could be, I look at others, they are partners, I'm jealous of what happens to this person earning more money He has a better house and oh  This tree I don't like anymore, I want a better tree, you know? You know, always, always parts of improving, improving, improving. And it's a restless energy. And it is this restless energy of always wanting to improve, which is based on this satisfaction that makes us put up the arms and always busyness, busyness, busyness. And now when we look  look into that, into the nature of that dissatisfaction, of that jealousy, envy, you know, rivalry, and so on, wanting to be the best. Again, same experience, nothing to be found. And surprise, surprise, completely happy. the dissatisfaction is gone. I can see that experience of now as  perfect moment of awakening. And that's why it is called all perfecting awareness. Whatever the situation is, that moment when the idea that it has to be different, when that idea is gone, when it is it is deserved, then this moment, this now, with the crooked tree in front and with my whatever old Volvo who had these starts, when I turned and the key, you know.  and so on. You know, all of that is a perfect place to be. And so that indicates also the energy of the wind, because the wind is the driving force which changes our world. It's the easiest to observe. Here, the wind moves the leaves and so on. Yeah, that's this energy of change, it molds, the sand, the mo...  the mountains and so on. And normally the drive of this karmic energy, the wind energy, is one to always make the world better. And now it can be referred to the all accomplishing activity of the Buddhas, which is only to show that the mind of now is a perfect place to be. So again, it is the all perfecting. you  awareness that is then the inherited energy of enlightened activity. So we have snatched all the five druids, we have them in our pocket now, and we take care not to forget that we have them in our pocket, they're always with us. Okay? That was the long short explanation. Okay, here we go. Yes, you. Oh, I still told you before that...  There was a finger over there to, who was that? Yes, you were first. Two, no, just one now. Yes. The tunnel end with the person that is, that has heard us. Now I reserve that photo model, okay? or tonight I don't want to overburden you.  and I don't want to speak about it now, but I do think that we will take a simple example of someone who has not been completely bad, but just a little bit difficult. Yes? So I will give you that missing peace also. Then you can ask your second question. Good deal, yes. But is that what?  Ah, have you ever tried to leave your mind? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm going to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a  You don't want to come back here. Now when you're liberated and then you leave this heavy word.  Yes. Aha, but there's a lack of generosity there of not wanting to come back. Uh-huh. Oh.  Yes, a readiness, a willingness. A willingness, there is already seemingly the willingness to open their hand once you're free. First you want to get free and then, a little bit before you can start opening their hand, right? open now.  It could be. You know, it's not so dangerous to open one's hand in the sense of opening one's mind, because it doesn't mean that the others eat you up immediately. you put your effort into the path, and there is different ways of walking the path.  And a very good one is to put a lot of energy into the path before thinking so much about sharing with others. Because you are much more effective if you begin sharing the paths with others when you have become really stable, like realized, then you will be much more effective in sharing. practitioners have this wish to share too early, very early and they do it.  and actually they don't really know what they share. So they share the semi-understanding of the Dharma. And this is good, the intention is super, but the effect is not as good as if you had given yourself a little bit more time to make the necessary efforts and study contemplation, meditation, you know in ethics and so on.  And then you take care from the safe spot. Okay, for you the answer, you can live with it. There is still a jumping board somewhere that you can jump off and to some near van away for some time you will be tranquill. You know?  not disturbed, it is possible to, if ever you need. But maybe when you have developed so much, you feel the need becomes less and less. What do you want to escape when you're able to snatch the jewels everywhere, you know? At this means to see the true nature of all the emotions. So we stop using this little bit strange image. but actually it's it's cute.  It's a good image, but we're seeing the nature of the emotions. If we do that, if we are capable of that, then we don't have to be afraid of some somehow. Okay? If there anything to be said for the draft, we want to view of feeling as time goes, I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going to speak first and I'm going  I repeat for you back there, is there anything to be said about dealing with Alzheimer from the point of view with a dharma practice? You know, my father has died of Alzheimer and he has really died of it, but of something else. I took care of him in the last two years. And I would say the one thing to always keep in mind is that...  Buddha nature, their qualities, that let's be more precise, and not just call it Buddha nature, the qualities or their capacity to love, to love, to smile, to, you know, to, is all there. And sometimes very much covered up, some of them they become even aggressive and so on, you know, different, there's different ways, there's not just the happy Alzheimer's, there's the irritable I said, so it's all due to what comes up then.  There will be moments in everyone where you see the beautiful qualities which are still fully present. So talk to those qualities. Try to touch those qualities and relate to them. You will live many surprises. Right now the mother of my partner, she is an Alzheimer and she is hanging in her wheelchair and able to...  to do something. But when we take her out and we bring her out on the mountains, you know, not high mountains, more mountains in Switzerland, where she has been before, suddenly she wakes up, she even remembers names of the mountains, or if we bring her to church, where she meets people from the village, where she has grown up. She's saying hello to everybody, she doesn't remember them, but with the names but she remembers their face.  and she feels, then she goes into a feeling of knowing everybody. And in the church, she has started to say hello to everybody and we drive her out and on the promenade along the lake constant, she shifts her two waves to everybody and she is just this radiating lady and everyone is so touched. Of course there is dementia, but you see the quality is shining through. So this is maybe the encouragement. I can give to all of you if you work with Alzheimer or if in your  You have some other side, some other. If one is one safe diagnosis, you see since my father died of it, I think it can happen to me. Yes, so I try to be as relaxed as possibly before I get the eye, some more and confident in the nature of my mind. of my mind.  when the word closes and I cannot express myself, I don't understand the things, I lose orientation and so on. That inwardly the refuge is clear. Inwardly if you know how to deal with your mind, then you're clear. Actually another story, the assistant of Gennardin Pertria. Poor Pertzeler, he was called. The hip.  died of Alzheimer. He came over from India, he fled from Tibet with his master, with Canadian poetry, stayed in India with him, came to Europe with him and died in Europe, surrounded by us with the Sangha. And he entered, entered Alzheimer and he was radiant until the end because he had complete confidence in his mind. It was just everything was This is a...  degrading but he was always okay. So this is what we need to develop before we get it. Time is now. Yes, I take you now, yes? I'm not doing anything.  There is a place where the moon is going to be chamatrabha. Yes. So you can hope that it is about the meaning of chamatrabha. Because even though it is less fabricated, it is very fabricated because it is very fabricated. Very good, very good. You didn't hear how the question is about chamatrabha practice in Mahamudra, which of course is less fabricated because the view of one would have...  there but somehow Shamabda is always with an effort, there's a little fabricated. So the place of that and your question is really pointing towards something I haven't given much attention to. Maybe I stay for another two weeks, that's a a very good idea. Actually I can announce it to you all. I will be coming back.  Yes, yes, yes. You have touched my heart so much, and I feel there are so many connections that have popped up. So, somehow we will make that possible. We don't yet know how, but okay. So, for the shamata, I expect it is very, shamata means calm abiding. The practice of mental calm. Yes, how do you translate usually? Thank you.  Oh, this is now you know. Mental calm, calm abiding. Okay. And I didn't talk much about it because we agreed that the people coming to this retreat, about there.  already have a practice, and that you already have received the instructions. Now, the view changes, but the practice itself doesn't really change. So, yes, and when you look into this blue book here, starting somewhere with lesson 24 or something, you have the shamata instructions on karma-biting. and you will see  That the Mahamudra tradition goes through working with all the different senses. You stabilise the mind on an outer visual object, on an inner visual object, visualisation, on hearing, physical sensation. You go through and you meditate on an outer Buddha statue, you visualise the Buddha inside. and each time  You stabilize, in the same way you would stabilize in the Vipassana tradition. Just as, of course, in the Vipassana, as well, I don't know how, where you are informed, but there are, of course, lots of possibilities, not just the breathing. But in the Mahamudra tradition, the two shamatha practices, which are the most used, is the breathing and the visualization of the Buddha.  because this introduces a feeling of devotion. And it's a mirror of our own qualities. So visualizing ourselves in the living presence of the Buddha has become one of the major shamater practices and the Mahmouda added. But the others, pure impure outer objects, pure impure inner objects, and so on we have a little classification of all the two  and supports, then it's the same. And we go roughly through three stages. The first stage of calmer biting is like a waterfall, where the mind is still very active. And you sit next to the waterfall, or maybe in the waterfall, but under the rock, so the water is rushing without pulling you along. The idea is active mind, but you're not involved. I'm sorry.  first stage. Second stage is like a river, like the flow of a river. So everything has come down already. It has calmed and the sensations, the physical sensations have become calmer. The mind has become calmer. You are familiar with the thoughts and there is a feeling of great calm, like sitting at a near a slowly flowing river or like being a slowly flowing river.  The third stage is like an unmoved clear lake, completely clear surface of the water, in the midday sun completely luminous. And this third stage of karma-biding is actually where we enter into the janas. This is, and then the sequence of the four janas and the  form and so on then this is the same and then the four additional ones, the eight ones altogether, it's the same Janas that can be experienced there. And the specialty in the Mahmouda approach to kamerbiding is that when the clarity of at least an advanced second stage or the third stage was next.  and the janas when that arises, that one doesn't focus so much on deepening the janas and going further and further, but one makes the practitioner the yogi purposely create activity in the mind. And to loosen up the aversion to the active mind. So one goes when the capacity to relax and to abide calmly without thoughts.  Then, when goes into the active mind and asks the practitioner to stimulate thoughts and to look through them, then again, calm abiding and then active mind. So there is a greater enhancement of uniting the clarity from the shamatha practice with the inside practice of the person. And this is the key point in the way we practice Shammata.  did it with you actually, but I didn't name it. We were, of course, practicing shammata, but I was giving constantly pointers of insight of the pasana. And what is the hallmark of Mahamudra practice is the unity of shammata and the pasana that you never separated to. But since there was ours to bring Mahamudra to this place and to you, then I got...  concentrated more on the view and then practicing shamata with a different view, which is actually a view of inside of constantly cultivating inside. And of course embedded in that bodhicitta, in that deep understanding of the four Brahma vihadas, Like you know, we did quite a bit of that.  So this is how Shammaja is in general practice. Okay. I didn't see where the next fingers went up. Yeah, I'm yes  the rest of the experience that I had in education, that I wanted to experience again and again, and I was thinking about what to do. Yes, yes, of course. Yes. Now I relax, it's not that happening right now. I'm starting to think of a...  Thank you. Thank you. The only interesting thing in meditation experiences is the inside that is left.  The transformation of the view. The rest is just like glass pearls, not real pearls. Leave them aside, or to say it more kindly. All these meditation experiences are just like flowers. In a spring, metal, you know, when the rains have fallen and the flowers come out, the applause and the...  go. Only the experience, how much it has transformed you, that stays. So don't even think of having them again. I hope you are happy to have asked the question. Okay, I got all the way  Back? Yes, yes.  The way it manipulates, the devotion manipulates you or influences you. Are you thinking about devotion towards the living teacher? No. Just to... Ah, when you like...  Like when I was talking about imagining the Buddha and developing the devotion to talk a little bit more about that. Exactly. Yes, yes, yes. Let me in.  Start a little bit further back. There is a reason that you came here. There is a reason that you chose to come into retreat. If you look at it, there is, to some degree, that is a devotion to understanding, to knowing the truth.  There's a devotion to liberation, there is maybe for some of you a devotion to the Buddha's teaching. There is, I have heard a devotion to Sangha, for some of you even to serving the Sangha. There is a devotion to the teachers, even not to me because you come maybe for Lila or Steven or for some others you have known here. And there is, you know, there is there are feelings of  devotion is a difficult term in English actually, because it translates for me from the Tibetan it translates the Tibetan word which is made of m\u00f6r, m\u00f6rpa, m\u00f6r, g\u00fc. M\u00f6rg\u00fc is translated as devotion, but actually the part m\u00f6r is to be inspired to and to inspired to the point of wanting to realize that. So the aspirage  Inspiration is so strong and Guru, Gupa means respect. So there's a deep respect and it's a feeling of entering a sacred field. Like something where you say, wow, I give my best, like this. So we translate this as devotion, which is not wrong, but actually it means means now I come to the  actually question, visualizing the Buddha, then it's meant that we see the Buddha so in such a living way, was all the qualities of awakening. So it becomes a support for meditating the qualities of love, joy, equanimity, patience,  all and composing wisdom, you know, and so on and so on. So the Buddha we meditate on becomes the support for our shamata practice and stimulates our whole aspiration to actually be like that. And then we hear, and even in the meditation there's an elaborate version where the wood.  a so much alive that he tells you, you are like me. And it's not a devotion where we separate ourselves, but the devotion and aspiration, respect, a gratitude to experience that, where that what we feel so inspiring is actually saying you're like me.  then dissolves into light, then the visualization dissolves into light and dissolves into us. So it doesn't stay separate. So the practice of the path of devotion in the Mahamudra tradition is actually only as a method to use something visualized, somebody visualized outside, a sphere of light, having the form of a Buddha. is what we are talking about. Visualized outside, murdered.  will always dissolve into light and come back into us. So no remaining separation. And in the process of meditating on the Buddha, we are actually stabilizing our capacity to dwell on the qualities of our mind. And then later on, having meditated for a while on such visualizations, I'm so sorry.  an outer support, we can take the support away, we don't need to meditate on the support of this image, of the inner representation, but we can go directly in contact with the qualities. For me, nowadays, no problem to enter into any quality and leave the mind there, well, Well, on that. So it's a sh\u0101m\u0101t\u0101, a vip\u0101\u1e63a-n\u0101 practice.  in the qualities of awakening, which is actually extremely helpful for this meditation practice to deepen those qualities or to make them come forth a little bit more. This is the idea of that practice. If you want to have a follow-up on that question, you're invited to because I tried my best, but maybe you want to say another word.  Can we come a little closer?  Yes, you see the Tibetan culture because it is so tantric has incredible emphasis on devotion, but it is not only in Tibetan culture that you live that. you go to Burma or Thailand into the monasteries and you see  how the students sit around the teacher, one of them takes his feet and massages them and the other takes care to bring some water. And they sit there and it's like a communion of minds. The practice of devotion is very much present also in the televada tradition, but it is not so formalized. It is something which is actually quite natural that you...  feel so much gratitude and then you almost, it's almost feel love for, no, you're not almost, you do feel love. You feel love not only for the teacher but for the teaching and for the Buddha and for the Sangha and this, this is what we are talking about and it has become a very central way in the Mahmouda tradition to cultivate this love and  aspiration, devotion to the point of always dissolving then with the Guru, not to leave the Guru outside but to let it dissolve and become the inner Guru, as a means to realize Mahmoudra, because it's possible through devotion, through love, it is possible to experience states free from eagle clinging so it has become a strong thing in the mind with our titties.  And it's beautiful. It's very beautiful. And it can be misused, you know, of course, power trips of Kuro's and so on. This we don't talk about now, but just so that it is mentioned. We are not talking about that. We are talking about a pure relationship and understanding of what we are doing. Actually the real devotion is never misused to make someone dependent but it is used.  as to strengthen the inner guru and to become independent. Okay. I have someone on. No, I don't have anyone on one. Do I? Did we plan this?

    "46.mp3": " Namodama, namosanga, namodama, namosanga. This.  beautiful movement going through the ages, which we call the Dharma transmission, is due to people entirely giving their lives for the practice and communicating their experience, receiving instructions, practicing them, communicating them again. And um...  They've been moving from different places to yet other places. Even you know, already the first year of the Buddha, after his first year of teaching, then he told to his students, we all go into different directions. And we meet again for the reign season retreat. but everywhere.  one spreads the Dharma. Everyone goes in different directions, not sticking together, but being completely available to the people. And kind of multiplying the surface, the surface of contact, contact surface. And so everyone had to rely on those deep insights that had already been...  they all had an incredible opening and they gave themselves to this practice of going through the countryside and going to each house. When there were all monks in those and that first year there was not yet a nuns or other model that was coming later.  It was the same rule for them when going to a village and all of India was mostly villages. Then there was supposed not to leave any house out, stand silently in front of the house, maybe do a chanting but not give it teaching or not calling but end-wait. and if the door open.  and some food was giving into their arms bowl with the request to give some dharma, they would say a few sentences of dharma. And this is a practice of the form, the very first year of the Buddha. It was he said, everyone in the villages, every single person, no matter what their lifestyle is, has to have the opportunity to practice generosity. Every single one,  don't leave out anyone, and accept what you receive. And if they ask you, share some Dharma. And so, somehow, tovana, like other places, they offer us the opportunity to practice generosity. It is the generosity and the courage of...  the Sangha of those running the place, it is their generosity to offer us possibilities to participate. And we are a participate in that. And it is a wonderful field of generosity which moves through the ages. It's just, it is just like another word for compassion. compassion. And now it is, it is like feeling the need.  responding to it. And so what made me come here, a very important point is that all of this is based on Dana. All of this is based on generosity from my side, from Lila side, from Tuvana side, everyone participating. Of course, we need to secure the lives of those who work a lot, so there are very few employees in the association that's very nice.  It's part of the generosity to secure the lives of those who they can kind of. You cannot estimate whether some person is working a Dharma organization, the income is very small. They could all earn more if they go somewhere else. So they are still continuing with Dharma practice when they have a little job in a Dharma association. It's still Dharma. I'm going to go on.  compared to other possibilities as a great extent of Dhana in there. So, Tauva Nga and the way I deal with my life and the way we have built up our association or actually non-profit limited, that's what Eka Yana is right now. going to be a foundation very soon. On Prophet Vandai.  We are running on the same principles. And the teachers, they take from the dana only what is needed for life. This is the agreement. We don't take from dana for fun. Yes? And it's an ethical way of using the donations exactly what they are meant for. So I feel that  and Eccahiana, which means one pass, one vehicle, that we have, I don't even know what to run on. Inside, huh, a very good name. Yes, yes, very good. So we work on these very well-tested It has the principle of generosity and it takes courage.  in this time, you know, in this century or in these years, it takes courage to completely rely on that and it needs skill. So they have developed a great skill here and I will listen to Lila's talk about that, how she will guide us in our contemplation of generosity. just want to let you know that usually  you give Dhan\u0101 to the teacher at the end, and there is a part of Dhan\u0101 to Taur\u0101na, which needs to run this island of sanity here, which we have to keep up. We have to get it going and keep it going through all times of crisis. And even if this place weren't available anymore, Taur\u0101na should continue, as in whatever. but the inside practice of this.  This path needs to continue because that's our legacy to future generations. So for me giving Dhana means to ensure the transmission of the Dharma now and these times, always with the wish that it may benefit future generations like our grandchildren, children that it is still there to benefit them. Or the children...  and grudges of our brothers and sisters. So I don't need much for myself. My life is well taken care of. So since eight years now, everything goes into this nonprofit organization, which is called Akayana. And that's the, for me, that's another beauty that even it It doesn't go to my personal bank account.  I can't, just I'm being taken care of, that's all. In a very simple way. So please do as if you were giving directly to the teacher, but know that it's my generosity, it's also my joy, that it is directly going to secure something that is very dear to my heart, to secure a retreat place at extremely low cost. Way up.  For example, up to now we only had like 600 euros per month, including all three meals in order to live in Germany. Yes, to do years of retreats. And up to five retreats were completely free of costs. They were having a receiving scholarship to stay there because they were coming from a poor country and poor background and so. But the motivation was right. So.  I wish to preserve through the ages, I mean through this time now, I wish to build up and keep a practice of deep inside meditation going in a very accessible place so that in the future there will be yet more people with this inside and an open heart to share the Dharma. This is my most sincere wish for me.  really I don't need much. I already have my bicycles and I will pick. Yes, yes, yes, and from my own money, so to speak. Yes, not from the dana, yes? Okay? So, yes, this was on my heart and I'm just going with the kajana we're going going so difficult times because we have to renovate the whole roof of this big big house.  to put insulation and the laws in Germany force us to put a lot of stabilizing structures for static security for earthquakes and so on and lots of fire protection measures into the house. So we have big sums to face and it's I know we can finance the first half that will be done this year but for the second half everything is missing. We don't have reserves So  continuous the second half of the house. So it will go for that, but actually it will go to the retreats in the future. Because we are preparing this in an ecological way, we have our own water reservoirs, we have the photo world type, we have the insulation of the house, we have a wood burner in the centre. So even if there is no outer energy supply, we can live and practice in that house. Yes, I am used to practice  in winter without heating, I've done this in my use, but if you have a big wood burner in the center of the house, you always have a place to go to, and we live in the forest, we own a little bit of the forest, and so there will always be enough supply for practitioners. So a little island of sanity, like here in Tawana, I feel very much like very close, very almost identical with the feeling and I and I  and over to Lila to listen to a beautiful Dhamma Dhamma talk. We cannot help but think about the herds of Israelis now flocking at your center.  thinking, where is the next flight? We are coming, lock your doors. Tell them it's close for now because of the veneration. But this has been recorded. We are patients. So this is the most beautiful thing to know in the wild spirit of the dana that we can even go further.  I love saying this about the dana, it's a radical act. And this is such a beautiful proof because the dana that we are giving here to teachers is going to the center, but what is the center but a collection of elements to help create This at once.  sphere exactly and for whom is it for us. So again this Sutra of the Buddha, I told it in the the weekend, the group that left. It's one of my favorite that we have three types of giving. One is the giving of the kaptana of the beggar that I'm feeling. I don't have enough, But I'll give anyway.  It's a very nice thing to do, especially if you're bigger. You always feel a lack. It's the hungry ghost state of mind. You always don't have enough, but still you manage to give. And it's such an amazing movement. And there is the giving of the Queen or the King. You know, they feel so generous. They feel so well off. They feel that they have so much. and they give with the  that feeling and when you receive with this feeling it's like such an abundance. You feel part of this movement, yes, of being a king or a queen. And there is the third giving in which there is no giver and no receiver and no gift. And we actually step away from the dualistic.  thought about me and the other, and we all co-create and participate in this beautiful love-making of being alive, this adventure of living fully. And we give to that which we want to support. Just reflect about all the things that we are giving our energy to, because you know money doesn't exist right?  You know, it's like a convention. And we really sort of solidified, it's one of the strongest solidifiers, huh? So strong and the psyche, and it makes such strong emotions as well. But I love the practice that Lamatilman was talking about this morning, but imagining, imagining ourselves.  before we're going to do something, like thinking about our day and just imagining how we sit on our computers, think like in a more serene way, not reactive way, for example. And just think and remember all the things that you give your energy to. And maybe think in advance before, what is it that you would love to support?  Because then, of course, money is just one, the monetary aspect is just one. And we are practicing the giving in so many facets of our lives and here in this blessed 10 days retreat that we had, the most beautiful teaching. Thank you, Lamaji. We had so many acts of generosity. Just see how the B is.  together in that way, the practicing together, taking care of each other, the kind looks, you know, in the small groups and opening the door, waiting with the door for someone to come in, you know, being patient in line, you know, for the food and so many small little of giving, I think you can really rest at point.  and let it soak our system, let it feel good with this. And this is the first, one of the first practices that we get when we go to practice in the East, because it has such a straight connection to our deeper aspects, because when we learn to be generous, we are generous with ourselves. Some years ago I was teaching.  here in retreat and I was talking about compassion and self-compassion and someone asked for one or one so we were sitting, I remember we were sitting on the lawn there and he said to me, this is really strong guy, he said to me, half jokingly but only half, he said, self-compassion is for the week. It's not translated very well I guess, but half jokingly, like the aspect of now we have to be so strong.  otherwise we won't be protected. A forgote, this is not translated. It's like it's from a Israeli cult movie. It's actually the opposite, the more we are flexible, the more we are like water, the deeper, the deeper we go, we are so tender inside we cannot go in with knives. It's just not happening. So this movement of giving is a major part.  when we are kind to ourselves, when we give ourselves the opportunity to be friends with yourself, to be compassionate, to be loving, we give ourselves the time to come and retreat, we give our partners, our loved ones the time to go on retreats, many of you do. such a big thing. And I always like to mention the hitchhiking guide to the galaxy.  No, no this one. Just this practice of being hitchhiker, which I love to bits, wild practices are getting less and less in this world, but still. And just to offer ride, like where I live most of you know, it's a very interesting place, just three buses a day, maybe if the bus driver is in the right mood, It comes in time.  usually not. So you have to give, right? Many people don't have cars. So it goes so nicely with what Tichnathan says about, used to say about giving. People ask him, how much to give? But we don't know, tell us, because you know, Dhan is sometimes uncomfortable. How much? But we want to be good people. We want to be generous, but we simply don't know. And he said, I don't know if you know it.  Make sure it will hurt a little. Very interesting. I'll text you. Make sure it will hurt a little. Of course, Christopher took it to the extreme with his British humor and said, what's the top of your credit card? He wants both. but make sure it with her to little, meaning when I...  I stop for a hitchhiker on the road. Usually it's not comfortable. I don't feel like picking anybody up into my space, my space, my, this, my, that, my Dharma talk that I just listened to, my, non-doing, driving, and always it's such a pleasure. I never, ever regretted it. So I'm just mentioning it this because it's something that you know that giving brings joy. and maybe the F.  is on joy. I'm so honored to join this lineage for years now. I've been teaching since 20 years exactly, voila. Never calculated it so far on the dot. And it's such a privilege. It changed my I teach you to money completely, really.  and 80 degrees, change one. The way I perceive it, the way I live it, and the simplicity part, and also the taking care part of consumerism, which is so tempting everywhere, such temptations. But you know this rule, when you say to something inside yes, You say, you see one tell is Lee.  to other things, no, and vice versa. He said, no, very clearly no. And then there is a yes coming. And it goes, it goes hand in hand, the simplicity, the taking care of our planet, of our world. What is it that we wish to support? For me, Dharma, practice and meditation and dana, all of it, make no mistake. and  We work with the deepest agents possible, our minds, our hearts, and this is where actions sprout from. So when we are more free and more open and more generous and more joyful and more loving, we say yes to this, we say no to war, animosity, hatred, anger, misunderstanding and so forth. So in this...  This lineage and tradition teachers don't get a fee. We don't have a sugar daddy somewhere who has finances. Thanks God, we are free in that way. Such a relief. And we are co-creating this together. We are participating in this joy of giving. I hear about Tillman's Center immediately. I want to come waiting for. I'm going to help with the building.  So it will be, I want to, it will be sooner than later. We don't have much time on this planet. Yeah, time is so short, so precious. Really what is really precious is not money. It's this, this opportunity that we have. And equally for overnight, it's been a little less than 20 years. I was part of this movement. I'm really proud about this.  push, to push our group to do this, to offer retreats on Dana. And the reservations were so strong, very understandably. And still, yeah, it's a beautiful act of trust. And actually, we're sitting here because of the generosity of others, which we don't know. And they heard at the end of a retreat, They heard the short dam Dana talk.  and they gave and that's how we can continue and continue and continue. So it's also really nice to know that and of course we sit here thanks to the generosity of the people in the kitchen and the people managing, amazing, amazing generosity. We'll have the time to say thank you I see I see you now and it's like feels my heart.  So deep deep thank you from here, from the heart. And I would like to offer a few moments just to reflection before we hear some practicalities for Michali and then we go and we take it as a practice.  is in silent to go to the dining hall and give the dana, but just sit with it for a little while longer and maybe feel into it. All the, maybe if you have opening, closing, push and pull, inspiration, non-inspiration, all this in the middle.  Don't leave anything outside. And let the wisdom be your guide. Let the joy be your guide. Let love be your guide.  keeping in mind that this gift of Dana continues to support us and support others. It's amazing acts of Dana all over, so inspiring. And invite herself to be that radical.  to join in.",

It means to be fed up. Do you understand? Yes, Fed up too much. And yes.  part of my being here was also to help you enjoy life, to find taste for life even under difficult situations. But I should talk to you about renunciation and readiness. It's Not this one. Often people don't like to hear the buff.  I mean, if I talk in Western Europe, renunciation is like, wow, sounds very much like giving up what they like, not being allowed to enjoy. But weariness is a form of wisdom and renunciation as well. We are talking about the form of wisdom that you will need.  And you go back home even more than here and retreat. And how would you translate readiness? Tired. Yes, tired. Tired and almost...  vomiting. The monastery where Gennadampuji grew up, not grew up, I mean, he grew up with his family as a moment, but then when he came to the monastery, the monastery was called chew and duck, the rock of awareness.  Some translators even use disgust. As a name for a monastery, quite a strong word. That's quite a strong word, but this is fed up with some salad. Now, what is some salad? We can hide behind that word. If we don't explain it as useless, we are some salad. I'm sorry.  Fed up with my tendencies to always take myself so important, to cling to everything that presents itself, including a version. Fed up with the complications that I produce. Fed up with searching ha-  again and again in cookies, chocolates, distractions, films, you know, a phone call here, the WhatsApp there, no 10 WhatsApp there, and one phone call there. You have to do it long enough to get fed up. You know that the young Tibetans, the generation of those.  who were the refugees in 1959, they came over from Tibet, some of them managed to cross the mountain. They were devoted to Dharma practitioners, the generation afterwards. They love everything that comes from the West and that is a sign of material, and so on and they only go into the monastery until they have a nice  So, a nice boy and then they leave the monastery. It's just a nice place for education. It's very hard to find an old Tibetan monk. There are some, but usually there's a lot and this is because they are not very. It's because they are fascinated. Now with you, I think we have a good chance that you are not fair.  fascinated anymore. I think with much of what is going on in this world, you are really fed up. And now take this as a starting point to simplify your life. To not engage further in complications, to make it simpler. And this is why you have become to retreat. I mean, you are doing it. This is the proof you are here. So you are out.  ready on that track. But when you come home, don't lose it. It's not that at home we continue in retreat. This is kind of giving a slap into the face of life. This is not what we are doing. Because there are different demands and we have to be open to them, we have to really take care of our responsibilities, sure.  very important. And then, a yogi is not only a yogi and retreat. A yogi is also and a yogini is also a yogini when coming home. This doesn't stop. Otherwise, one has to laugh about this term, yogi and yogini that you are using here and to one now. It is not true.  Yogis and yoginis you cannot be for 10 days. It's not possible. It's an attitude for one's whole life. It's a life attitude. It's because you've got the taste of the Dharma and you have a yoga which is now in our context we can call it because that's the official term, Mahmouda Yoga, the yoga of Mahmouda. Yes. Tibet, Nile, Georgia has said.  the direct translation of yoga. And that's our practice, or the person as a term for your yoga. Whatever you call your practice of the path of liberation, that's the yoga. Now, where your Gini is and your Gini is? If this is really the top priority in our life.  We might spend more time with other things, because we are obliged to. But we transform everything that we do, what we spend the time with, we make that into our yoga. Okay? So if you are an accountant, typing along on your computer, bookkeeping, make that into Yoyoko.  make that into your practice. Whatever you are doing, don't leave the yoga outside, the yoga is not reserved to the practice in the morning and in the evening. This is only the formal frame. This is the training ground for the informal yoga of everyday life. Hadoog.  and your kidney, their practitioners all around the clock. We never stop, we never stop. Don't ask me how much you should practice. Your whole life 24 hours, 24 7, okay? All around, all around, all the time. You understand then?  why this yoga has to be relaxed? If it is not reserved for a few hours here and there and then occasionally retreat, but if it is once whole life, it has to fit. It has to be a yoga that we can do all the time. This is interesting isn't it? It's a perspective. I hope it isn't.  not new to you, if it is new it might be shocking. Yes. Make it, you know, in the words of the tradition that probably what is most taught here, then make satsi, which is the essential ingredient of the yogi, of the yoga, the quality of their way.  is directed towards what is liberating, directed towards what is most helpful. This makes Sati the center of your yoga. Okay? I think the word Sati is probably used here in the teaching. So it's probably one of the most current terms. And this reminding oneself of what is more...  most important, this goes along with the meaning of life that I have explained in the last teaching. So always staying close all the time, staying close to what really inspires you. All the time, all around the clock. This is the quickest way to happiness and liberation.  close to what is really inspiring to you and you will be happy when right now you got it right now all the time yes and this is how a yogi and a yogini are happy because they are sati dwells their awareness dwells in what is the real purpose of life for them  So, be clear, what is your yoga when you go home? I'm not talking about just asanas, body posture, call it sitting on the cushion or something. Even the old word yoga, that potentially who probably lived in the second century after then you also develop an  And the eightfold path of Patanjuli, you can study it is very similar to the Buddha's path. Just he condenses the elements of right-life, right-speed and what's it for God. He condenses them a little bit and made more space for Asana and Plana Yama to include that. Yeah.  Phran Ayama is the art of working with your energies. So he included the practice of Asana, which is to work with one's body and the other energies, and the rest is the same. The rest is absolutely the same. This is where the word yoga really nowadays gets its meaning from. Nobody knows, but actually he has had no devotees, no one knows who he was. He disappeared and everyone claimed.  that I am in the traditional patentially, but there is no traditional patentially. It is just that we have the text, okay? And for chapters and so on. But the word yoga comes from there, comes from the Hindu tradition. And it has of course been there before the Buddha. He was a yogi, a special...  So we practice a yoga of which we are being told that Sati is the core, the one path. That one ingredient without which nothing works. So this Sati, and by the way, you also find it with potentially. He kept it. This is this sati which leads to Samadhi and which leads to Abh.  understanding is and the whole thing reinforces each other. Now, actually the yoga, the traditional way you would define the yoga of someone on the path to liberation, you would say, yeah, it's the 8th of Noble Path. That's my yoga. This is the more precise description of my yoga. So when we come home, we...  all around the clock, your Ginnies, then you establish a good basis of ethics, which is on the basis of the right motivation, the second element of the 8th of Noble Paths, and which is already an expression of the view, of that we are all interconnected and that harm done to one affects Everybody, happiness.  of one affects everybody. There's a view there which nourishes the hostomotivation, which nourishes the ethical conduct, which is the basis for meditation, for going into the depths of our clarity, our presence until it becomes really precise and is able to see and understand the nature of reality.  which is then the understanding that marriage not just the view again, which makes the motivation to share this with all sentient beings even bigger, because the more understanding that is, the more we are clear that we have a medicine to share, with all those who are also sick. Many are sick, if not all, but not all are wary.  Okay, not all are fed up. Some love their complications. Yes, and if you want to share the medicine with them, they'd say, I don't need medicine, I'm not sick, everything is fine. You know, I have a party every day, if I want every night, or at least every weekend. And I have my beer, I have my whatever, yes? It's okay, family.  For Yogi and Yogiini this means, okay, this is maybe not quite the right company. This is not where I find Sangha. So Yogi and Yogiini, like in the old times, they go to places where they find other Yogi's and Yogi's. So that they can exchange. Now at least we have the Internet nowadays.  So we can have forums, we can discuss, even at a distance, we can keep the contact, we can log into platforms and listen to inspiring contributions of the Sangha. And this is part of what yogis and yoginis do. The yogis and yoginis from which the Mahamudra tradition comes, they lived on the channel grounds. is.  were the burial grounds, not burial, the cremation grounds of the Indian tradition. During the day, they performed the necessary rights for the people who brought the dead corpses. And as soon as the fires were taken care of and so on, then they did their practice. Very much at night also, So they practice all the warm the clock. Warm the practitioners.  They live together with the Hindu yogis and with that's why in Mahamudra we have a lot of techniques you know that has been in exchange of this asanas and we have a lot of funnaryama techniques we have visualizations and sometimes you don't know is this Shai Vitsu, Shiva tradition is this Buddhist tradition many crossovers and they have learned you know it has become more and more also a non-dueler approach  the sense of not the Atma Brahma non-Jewelty, but the non-Jewelty or subject object that we are talking about. I've been a lot of cross-exchanges. Anyhow, why do I say that? I'm going around this word Yoga and Yogi Yogini. I want to inspire you to be City Yogi's. I would love you, I mean most of you probably live in one of the cities.  And even if you are a village, then you are a village yogi. It's fine. Or you are a beach yogi or whatever. Wherever you are, but please practice and don't ask how much should I practice. If you can't practice much formally on a question, Nevertheless, you can make your whole day a practice.  And when you try that, you will see that you fail all the time. Yes, and you will say after trying it, three days, impossible. No, you try too short, try your whole life. Yes, don't give up, you will get better, and you will need practice times. You will see that you actually need them, and you will become thirsty for them, hungry. and you will grab  the practice times as soon as they present themselves to you. You will not let them be eaten up by other activities because you're wary of some salad, you want to become free, and you don't let useless activities like this useless chatter with people talking about others who are not there, for example or films that have seen  discussing politics and all of that, you know, you won't let this, how did you say, social word? Social media, yeah. You won't let that eat up your precious life. Two precious, you have had another bit, I think you have tried it, you know how much it helps, you take only the part which helps only that. Foo, this is a yoga.  to only use the computer what is helpful. That's quite a yoga. Wow! To only use the smartphone for what is helpful. Wow! Here we have the challenges of nowadays. But it's the same challenge as when before the yogis and yogin is visited each other for a cup of tea. And then to know when the conversation is  finished and to go and go back to practice instead of staying together and the BD and VD, you know, whatever you call it, yes? Yeah, I learned this on the beach here, unlike the BD, yes, a VD. So...  You have to know the times to stop. When you did what you wanted to do and know more, this is wisdom. Okay? It's wisdom and it's compassion. This readiness, this fed up, is actually a clear sign of wisdom. And then to do what this readiness tells you and to cut with all those distractions and and all this complicated...  you know, this is wisdom and it's another act of compassion. So to simplify our life is the best thing we can do. One thing less is always one thing less to take care of. We always have this idea when we buy something new that it will stay new and that it is not a problem.  It won't. It takes space. We have to start it, then we try it, and then we see, oh, it has a little my spaghetti sauce. Yes, and then we have to wash it, and then it doesn't get out, and then, you know, out of that, you know, complexities everywhere. It's already nice.  If you only have one smartphone, it's already nice. If you only have one phone, many have several. To take care of. It's already nice if you have one bank account only, but most have several. To take care of. Then you have so many followers, maybe, on your LinkedIn or wherever you are. Yes? Hey. You take care of...  Your social media? Yes, you want to take care of how many, how many extra things have come into your life? Wow! Someone, you know, the worst is you already have a car and someone offers you another one, then you have two cars. Another one to take care of. Simplify one thing of that which you need. and for  your clothes only as much as fits into a small cupboard, right? Make it simple. Make your life simple. You know, to stand in your cupboard and to look left and right and you don't know what to put on and save that time. Yes, you know, it's precious. Be simple, that means at the same time that\u2026  you look pretty much the same every day. And I know some of you are doing that and it's great, do it. Do it. Don't try to look special. It makes life so simple. I'm very happy to see that you are like this, that many of you are doing like this. It's wonderful. So continue when you go home. It's not only for retreat. between  I don't know this Sanskrit word, but the Tibetan word is sum for retreat. And this is to establish boundaries. It means that I don't cross the line. And this line is, I don't go into destruction. I stay in that space of no destruction. And that's the yoga. So one can...  claim that one goes home and one is in retreat at home, but that means that at home one does what is necessary and one does not engage in distraction. It is not making life more complicated. And this you can do. I mean, I don't know if it is for society, I really don't know. I'm getting to know. But my suspicion is that it is not so different from the way...  we live. I mean, outwardly, politically, yes. But probably if we look into the rooms of children, we find 95% useless toys. Yes, that's our world nowadays. And this, it starts so early, accumulation accumulation and when you are young parents you know you get everyone everyone is  often you are difficult to say now and suddenly you finish up, you need another room for the toys and one for your kid. It's like this. I mean, I'm of course exaggerating to some extent, but are you even saying no, no, because I do know families like this. And it is... is simple, simple, okay, simple, always.  more simple. It's such a joy. I live in a room of 16 square meters, 16, 4x4, and everything is in there. Okay? Except my three bicycles. I'm okay.  I admit. One for tracking, one for the mountains and one to go along distances with a motor. But okay, it's mine. Yes, we have such sides. But all of them are used. They are more than 10 years old. You know, I'm not.  I'm not replacing them like other nerds, you know? I'm not replacing them all the time. You know? So take care of that. Use the things to the end. Make your life simple. Don't be always best informed, top of the whatever. No need. make it simple.  Make it simple. Are you still repairing your clothes? Sometimes to put a button, you know, to sew on a button and sew. Wonderful. I do it as well. Let's keep that practice. It's part of our yoga. Okay? Let's not just throw things. Yes? Okay. How to... Ah? Yes. Oh my God. Yes, yes.  because there are so many zippers now everywhere, right? So yes, and there is the, how you say the scratch, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, or whatever, yeah? And so on. Yeah, to make life more easy. So, taking the yoga of practice at home is a decision about how I want to live my life.  And it's not always that funny as when we talk about it, because with the change of attitude you might lose friends. You might lose people, which were dear to you, but the way of dealing with life and looking at life just is so opposite and with the time.  as a yogi, yogini. Yes, there's also a letting go of contacts of dear friends that are actually enjoying complications. Not they're not worthy. They're not in the process of simplifying. you  And the good news is that we are not spending that much time with them, there is time to meet others. Of the same kind, the Sangha, the closer Sangha. We never kick anyone out of our heart, we are always there, and when our old friends want to see us and exchange with us, we are there. Okay, where the dawns needs to follow every invitation.  We don't need to keep on, keep on, keep on these threats of communication all the time. If there is no deeper meaning to it, I really want to encourage you. And over time, talking about, I've met many people in my life and of course not so many have stayed, yes? And it's very sad when you're best friend from school times, to show why I spend all the...  time, even moving into the Dharma, we were still together. But then when you notice, going different ways, going different ways. The most interesting thing about what you could tell me about Israel was, oh, you know, there is a beach for homosexuals and there is an app where you can see who is the homosexual closest to you and with that app, you can find him and start talking with him. talking with them.  That was most interesting. Yes? So, not really my word, not because of homosexuality. He was already my best friend being homosexual. That was already an hour's good times. That's not the issue. But what is interesting are not really the bars of Tel Aviv. Okay? It's not really... Yes, and it's sad because we were really close.  We did everything together. We slept in one sleeping bag. We traveled together. When I lost my clothes in a truck, we were hitchhiking, then we had one sweater and one pair of trousers. So one of us was wearing this sweater and the other one was wearing the trousers. It's a lost bed sleeping bag. spread one sleeping bag to sleep both another and we had always to  at the same time. It was in Mexico and Guatemala, okay, warm climate, but then in Guatemala we could buy some extra clothes and then it was a little bit easier. But you know, this really is kind of really close friends. I mean, I hope you know what I'm talking about, and then it's a little bit difficult to see that the path is going in different directions. And then we...  need courage. Yogi Yogi needs courage to go the path of liberation, to go the path of practice, of awakening. It's not by staying ordinary that we will reach there. And away, although we try our best.  become a little bit outsiders, a little bit, you know? It's not really, we are not mainstream society, and we will never be. It's not, we can function in the world very well. We can be mainstream in our job, you know, we can be in there. But even when we do our job, people will see that we are doing it differently. where we adjust a little different.  And then a good way. So I want to encourage you to have that self-care that really good taking care of yourself, which allows you to continue your practice around the clock. All around the clock.  We know, it also happens to me sometimes that I would like to stay in bed longer because, you know, sometimes it's cold outside. It's nice and cozy. And since I don't want to get up, my trick is I roll out of the bed. I roll under the blanket until I'm on the floor. I'm sorry.  That makes me laugh every time. But I'm already happy to get up because it's a trick. I don't like this movement of lifting the blanket. You see, this rolling out is a different movement. And I know it's part of my yoga.  To trick myself into getting up when I am awake. The agreement with my teacher was, you get up when you have the first clear thought. When you notice that you are awake, that's the moment to get up. Don't pretend you are still sleeping, you saw? Okay, so this is the agreement.  And then I have two ways of getting up. One is the rolling out. The other is to sit up in bed with the blanket and then to start practice sitting in bed, which is also a good way to do it. The practice has started and the first thing is always the refuge, always. directly going for the effects. And I've been doing this  Yes, definitely for more than 40 years, yes, definitely. So, always, first thing, remembering the yoga. That's what the Refuge is about, remembering the yoga. So, remembering, what is the purpose of my life? First thing, there's the first thought of waking up, you know, Oh, you're under...  you realize, oh, I'm awake, and then you can say, one more Buddha, another Dharma, another Dharma, another Sangha. And I do this usually when I'm still lying, because it comes immediately. So I do my, I do most the anti-battern. I do my four lines of refuge prayer, which I've become so habituated to, and I understand the meaning. So that has become a habit. It's a good habit. because waking up  like this in the morning, as the yoga of waking up and remembering the past and makes all the rest easier. And it's a good preparation for when you wake up after leaving this body. When you wake up in the bar, so in this intermediate state, when you come back to consciousness, it's like coming back from sleep. Now, if you have developed that habit of immediately remembering Thank you.  of immediately remembering your practice and not dwelling in whatever could go on in mind, then you are safe on the other side, you will immediately start your practice. So the way to get up in the morning is actually linked to the way we will come back to consciousness after having left this body. And I think you know enough.  from the teachings about what happens after leaving this body, these are very crucial moments. It's very important to have a yoga, then to be able to deal with that mind that comes back to consciousness and then accelerates, that becomes quicker. And what my impressions like in the dream world. Yes? So to remember the yoga at that time.  It's already a good start. Like it is a good start for the day. And to go to bed, what we will hopefully do soon, is the yoga of preparing to die. So yoga of preparing for our last conscious breath. So that is also a daily yoga. Yeah, yeah, what do you...  want. So there is a daily yoga of saying goodbye to this day, to this day of being conscious, of being present, of having practice. Can be moments of gratitude. And usually what we do in the Tibetan tradition is this blue Buddha that I was talking about, about this blue you  Buddha comes into our heart and sets us there for the night. It is dark blue in that sense because then you don't, it doesn't disturb sleep. It's not bright white, it is dark blue. So it helps. And then from this dark blue Buddha as you fall asleep, just these last moments of consciousness there is dark blue light filling.  your whole body, feeling your whole room, going to all living beings, and touching all of them, and wishing them to be happy. So the step by step process is really once on body, once room, the whole house, when the whole of Tawana, then the whole kibbutz, Then going to the villages around.  you know, no mantra, war, but it's like everything around the whole area. Is it called Galilee here or what is it called? Yes? Yes, like this, yes. And then you go further and you have no limits. There's no limits. The borders between countries and earth makes they don't exist. but the light goes everywhere. It goes to all...  animals as well, it touches the storms and the plants and the lakes, and it touches all of them, and usually I get lost in the forest sleep when I'm dead far, but it could actually come back the light, and it can come back and get there again in your heart. And that simplicity of just you  connected with your Buddha nature of being with simple mind and in that state you fall asleep. So this is a nice way of connecting with all sentient beings in Bodhi-chita before passing over into the sleep or living with body. Okay.  And there is a saying, I don't know, maybe it's a Tibetan saying, you don't know what comes first. Next day or next life. As it's a medical that during one's whole night, heavy out breath is followed by an in breath.  and sometimes it doesn't happen. So that's why we always prepare. Okay, it was a little bit longer now. I didn't think it would talk so long. It's quarter to ten now. Let's dedicate. I will sing again the Tibetan dedicated. Yes, I know the...  Ancha, how about? Oh, and I will dedicate to Jonathan, our friend and teacher who is in hospital, and I dedicate to Hans, who is in hospital and dying, and I dedicate to all of them, who are already dead in the process of dying, sick. Enter the  Because it's of being born or not yet born. Okay.

    "2.mp3": " Welcome to this evening teaching and meditation. And first thing I would like you to know who is giving the teaching, it's this one. And I dared to bring it into the meditation hall. I have been told about the good old custom not to represent the ultimate. And this was also a crass term in...  the Buddhist tradition. I don't know if you have been to India and if you could visit the caves of Ajanta, these are the oldest stone carvings of the Buddhist tradition and there's no Buddha there. The seed, the throne is empty because in the early centuries there was no representation of of the Buddha. You know, with...  And this was the Greek artist, the Greeks. When they came across the Hindu Kush, Alexander the Great, Elephans, 3333, and so on, the whole story, then he came over and he entered the place which was called the Kingdom of Gandhara. This is a Gandhara Kingdom actually lasted for 700 years in this era which is nowadays Pakistan.  going up to Kashmir Ladakh that region. And he went on to there and he was a little bit tired, but he left his artists and he exchanged elephants for peace and he left someone there and retreated. And these artists, they said, what, you don't have a representation of your God, the Buddha, they thought it was a God, and they tried out all kinds of representations of the Buddha.  writing on a horse because he was a prince or with a kind of armor because he was strong. But finally, fortunately, the peaceful version succeeded. Yeah, this was the success. And of course, he was shaved. I mean, he didn't have this little blue hair, all-coat on his head. He was never like that. He was probably quite emaciated. But emaciated was not good because it...  Yes, like he was really thin and only eating one meal a day and you know he had been very thin, bony, really, when he attained enlightenment but since he is radiating peace and serenity and prosperity and all of that then the Greek made him a very well-proposient, everlasting young man. It's by the of all his teachings on change and impominance. He was making...  the eternal you and he is my teacher. I never met him, but from my early childhood I was very inspired every time the the world came on him and I considered myself a Buddhist at the age of aging without ever having met a Buddhist teacher. So I was really like very inspired by that and started meditating at that time and later on  I met, this was when I was in 1981, yes, I was 22 years old. In my medical studies, and Gennudin Pocci, this Tibetan teacher, came to Freiburg in Germany, southern Germany where I was studying. And my girlfriend, she said, there's this Tibetan master coming, you should come and I said no, I practiced Vipassana. You know, that's enough for me.  And actually I was very much sad. No, no, you have to come. And this good old guy, he was talking the whole weekend on Budi Chita. I will also fill your ears with Budi Chita, teaching on the enlightened mind, Budi awakening, Chita mind, mind of awakening. And it touched my heart. And I was like, so much, This is one weekend.  I mean, we're just having a weekend for some of you. So I won't be able to do what he has done to me. But it was very inspiring. And later on, I became a student. So for the last 11 years of his life, I lived with him. I stayed in retreat seven years. He made me one of his successors. And I guided the retreats after him. These three years, three months, three treat. Maybe you've heard about that. It's one of those customs in the Tibetan tradition, special.  the country and the English tradition. We do these long retreats and that has become my life. I didn't become a doctor, finally because of him. He said, after I had finished my seven years of retreat and I was made a retreat teacher, and I said, but I have debts with the government in Germany. They financed part of my studies and he said, how much? And I said to some, And if I go to work as a...  Dr. Half a year, I can easily pay that back. And he said, we can take it from the dharma, from the donations. You don't waste your time being a doctor. You know, you teach dharma. And within a year, you know, by the blessing of Buddha Dhamma Sangha, of, you know, I could pay back everything without ever going back into hospital. And this was kind of his example. You live from...  and Dhamma is only Dhamma, like you live it here in Tauvana, it's really same place. It's like this. The Dhamma is for free. You have to pay for your lodging and food, that's clear. But Dhamma is always for free. And when our money was running out, you know, we had built this this retreat center and our resources were out he said, well no more money, build a stupa.  You know, spend the rest of your money on building a stupa and you will see. And it worked. You know, and this is like how I got involved with this very inspiring person, Ganondon Pudjim. I got involved with actually developing a very large monastery, Mahamudra tradition in France, learning Tibetan with him, becoming a translator from Tibetan into mostly German, but also English.  French and this if you want to understand me you have to understand this guy unfortunately when I put together this book in German we also translated it into English so you can have a look I will pass it through you just pass it on to everybody just as I'm talking just let it let it move through so you have a little idea because to talk about me is not much of an issue.  you if you don't know these two. Yes, and and God Almighty, we call him Shakyamuni Buddha and our tradition, the mighty one of the Shakyas, which was the clan, the family he belonged to. Then he inspired me so profoundly that still today I studied his teachings, his sutras, and it has been my joy and also supported by my teacher, Gennadon Pichet.  to combine the tradition coming from the Pali text, the Pali Sutras, with the Sanskrit Sutras and the Tantras, which are also in Sanskrit, a Tantric Buddhist teacher, so to combine these different strands of teaching. And it is in this spirit that I come here in this one Dharma It's one teaching and basically  we will never be doing anything else, but to practice the four noble truths and the eight-fold noble parts, maybe you know what I'm talking about. Mahamudha is not something else than that. It is just an elaboration on the theme. It is giving a little bit different accents to the teaching. And it's my pleasure to share that with you. And he encouraged me very much all of what I had learned and the Vipassana Tradition.  I was in the tradition of Sire Uberkin, this mother Sireme, she was a co-student with Goenka, with Uberkin and she taught in England. So I had these three months, I went over to do a 10-day retreat because I just felt I needed another injection to speak in booster for my spiritual motivation to keep up my daily practice with me for months I had to go. So I went and said with  her and I said many retreats, I said with Anna Gara Kamuninja in Bhad Gaya that was a famous teacher at that time in India. And it was in those days also together with my then wife, she's Buddhist nun today. I also was a Buddhist monk for 21 years but she is still a nun today. And it was in those days that we sat together with Stephen Batch.  of that fun I'm studying Abidharma together. You know, these all these which are, you know, from the Vipassana tradition nowadays, at that time, some of them they were studying Veskasha Raptin and Tibetan Gilukbath tradition. And we were moving everywhere we could receive Dharma. I did my Mahamudra preliminaries, which are usually 11,000 prostations, but we definitely...  did them in kilometers. Yes, moving from one teacher to the next, doing our kilometers, and going to the Netherlands, seeing someone in Italy, going to France, coming back to Germany, you know, wherever they were, we followed, because it was very rare in those times. Very rare to meet them, very precious, and this affluence of teachers that we have now was not there and not to speak of books, you know, we all read this.  same books. You know, you could know them all in those days to put this books. There was no, so we basically got the same training. Poneca, for example, yes, was Philip Kaplow, the three pillars of Zen. And so on this world, we studied the sutras, the sutras, if you want, and no one understood them really, but they were very inspired.  And we asked our teachers, what do they mean? They tried their best to explain to us. And like this, we grew up. Like this, we matured a little bit. We saw the need for practice. And so instead of settling down as a homeopathic doctor after my studies, I was offered a place in Switzerland. Together with my wife, we decided to say, okay, we get the foot into the door. for  Before settling down as a doctor, because then I can't be free anymore. We take four years, four years for practice, intensive practice in full retreat. I build a block house in France next to my teacher, General Rinpoche, who lived in Dordonia, in southern France at that time. And we went into retreat and we thought, we are doing the great thing. And when we ask General Rinpoche, can we come for retreat? treat you know we have four years.  He said, yeah, yeah, you're very welcome, you can come. But be prepared that it might take a little longer. This was the first interview with him about retreat. Because he came out of 30 years of retreat. He had done them in caves and he malayas, he had done one retreat of seven years, one cave of Padmasambhava, Guru Rinpoche. You know, this guy was actually meditating.  with just a cotton shower in the snows, this good old tumult practitioner who didn't need to heat up externally. So it's this kind of transmission, which I received then, which I'm passing on. Also there's lots and lots to that transmission, like thousands of hours we were sitting with him and receiving explanation, then I'm not exaggerating. It's really thousands of hours, yes. So many managers.  and many encounters. And if we are going to condense that into a weekend, we are not going to try. No, we are not condensing something else. I will try to hear what you are saying, look into your eyes, try to feel what you might need, and choose from that very rich background that which is most helpful to you. you continue for the rest of the  week for those who wish to stay and just pass on as you can maybe hear from how I talk about that pass on some of the inspiration. That's maybe the most important thing. Now when I am asked what is Mahamudra, which is maybe also a question into the room now, because I hear I've been asked by Stephen and Rila to kind of introduce the Mahamudra.  Here, is that right? Yes, so here in Indoha and Toba now, and Mahmouda is a way to realize the nature of mind through blessing. That means through inspiration. It is using the power of inspiration, you know, an opening of the heart, which goes beyond all that self-protection, and audit.  so called Eagle Klinger. We will talk about that, what is meant by that. But to leave that beyond, by an inspiration where we forget ourselves. So it's called the path of blessing. Mahamudra is not for the studied ones. I have studied a lot. Fortunately, from the point of view of being able to explain, it's always good to study if you want to explain the Dharma, but maybe unfolds.  Because I've spent so many hours studying, studying language, studying text, translating and so on, I should have meditated. I should have maybe used the time to practice a little bit more. So I was sure that with you as much as I can, the various sources of inspiration. and that has been of good guidance to me and to my students, to my fellow practitioners and of course.  to all those centuries of practitioners. And you know that the Tibetan tradition has been proven by disaster. Yes, it has gone through difficulties that you know of. You know, they were all excited. These teachers only came to us because of living through heavy situations. and they're...  all lost many people. Two million Tibetans were killed of the five million, which were there. It's a big number. I know what the Jewish people have gone through. I know what led to the founding of Israel. I'm very aware of that. And I'm kind of bringing you the Dharma that has worked for the Tibetans to be so happy, so loving, in spite of all of...  that and maybe a sum would say because of it. Gajshan Rampurjee, one of the famous teachers of the Drikham Kajulini, who spent 20 years in prison, you know, coming out from there. He talks very touchingly about how he used every difficulty to strengthen his practice. And he did. and we were  I will share that with you. Of course, I've also had my challenges, but probably not like you. But I will share some of that as it comes along, the main teaching will be on meditation. But there is more to the Mahmouda tradition than meditation. It is not just that. In the little text I wrote for you, when announcing this course, I gave a summary of the Mahmouda tradition. Maybe you will...  Remember, I will take it as a starter now. The Mahamudra, if you want to explain later when you come home and someone asks you, what is Mahamudra? Please remember three words. Three words. View, meditation, action. View, meditation, action. We have to do with an action-oriented form of practice. all about activity.  And that's maybe a new thing for you. When, you know, I don't know how, for example, Lila teaches Omikr, but the classical Vipassana approach is not so much about activity. It is maybe more about individual liberation and spending a lot of time in retreats, in silence, and so on. the Mahamudra.  approach is one for very much designed for so-called householders, for people living at home, working, having children, maybe having a farm in those days, and going the path of the Buddha's Satva. And that means some Buddha's Satva means Satva is a being, someone, and body walking the path of body of awakening. But me.  first, walking a path of uniting compassion and wisdom in a very active way. Like, I guess most of you are doing. I see, I see looking to your eyes and I can see many, many who have that aspiration to actually find ways of uniting that. And it was meant for people who liked the Buddha.  wanted to spend the rest of their life after finding a awakening to share it with others. Maybe you know the lifestyle of the Buddha well enough to know that he was enlightened at the age of 35. That's quite young. And he was so fortunate to live until he was 80. So for 45 years he worked a country like yours, barefooted and up and down.  in northern India and all across, and answered two questions. That was basically his job. He was only answering two questions all the time. And that became his teaching. And he served the people. He served the rich. The outcasts, the poor, the prostitutes, the farmers, wherever came along, He made no difference. Everyone was welcome. And that's the basic method.  we are continuing today and it is this activity of the Buddha after his Nielvana, after having found that deep peace of mind. It is one possible translation of a Nielvana. Here's this deep peace of mind when he had found that, he felt encouraged to share it. And it was difficult. It did not know the words. He was struggling to find the words to share.  And we, two and a half thousand years later, we have a very strong tradition of words now. We can rely on the words of our teachers and of all these generations who have passed on the words. And nowadays we have them in many languages, many, many, many languages. I just went the last night with my Greek translator.  she has translated the major Mahamudra manual into Greek, the ocean of true meaning, by the ninth Kamapa, one of the big, big reference books. And it's even now arriving in Greek language. Now they make the same wish for the Hebrew language, you know, made the dharma flourish in all our languages. So we have tradition of words and  We have a tradition which started with the Buddha of going beyond the words, that the true Dharma is not the word. Remember that, that's simile of the Buddha with the raft, where he compares the Dharma, the words of the Dharma with the raft, which takes us across the stream, the stream of suffering. I'm sorry.  cross some sardar. And he asked his students, when you reach the other shore and the raft has done its purpose, will you carry it on your back with you, will you continue? No, no, no, you leave it to heavy, you leave it there. And he said, that's the same with the words of the dharma. They will carry you across, but when you reach the other shore, the Param Ita has been accomplished, you've gone to the other shore, then you become  From the Dharma you are the Dharma and the Dharma we speak from within. And then don't rely on words but rely on the Dharma within. Recall that the Dharma of realization. And Mahamudra is very much such an approach where yes, one relies on the words but knows that the true Dharma is beyond the words. Darwin.  not be able to convey the Dharma to you just with the words, there will be more like pointers to the moon, another famous example. We say in the Mahamudra tradition, to teach is like the old lady pointing at the moon. You know, the old lady pointing to the moon, I don't want to offend anybody in the audience. I'm getting out myself and my pointing to the moon very  much look like the lady, look the moon is there, but look how my fingers. My finger is crooked, the finger is not even pointing to the moon, you know, it's the old lady, she knows the moon is there, look the moon is there and her finger points back to the earth, right? It's like the words are clumsy means to indicate what is really meant, words are clumsy, even if they are poetic, Even if they were chosen, they are not too.  reality we are talking about. And I want to make this clear right from the beginning, that we are from a Buddhist tradition, where we use the words and the best possible way with very clear definitions, but it's not the definitions which give the awakening. It's what we call the pasana, huh? The intuitive insight, the clear seeing, which comes from within it is there.  it is this non-conceptual understanding. So we will see what we can do in these days. And that was my little introduction. Let's meditate now. Let's see what we can do. View, meditation, action. I've given you a little bit of the view. I've pointed out that action is where we are going. that means we are going to implement it.  in everyday life, a meditation means to become accustomed, to become familiar. And what we become familiar with is the nature of mind. It is just how it is. And how is it? Let's have another look. I will guide a little bit that will appear of silence.  invite you to make yourself comfortable. I'm very happy to see that some of you you have already taken the support of the wall. Please do that, lean against the wall if you feel like it. The others with energy, you're very welcome to sit straight. But if you feel like wanting to rest and to give it up to the wall, Let the war carry you. Please feel free to.  do that. Oh, this is so good that you take that inspiration and you do it very good. I hope others follow your example if you need this.  Okay. Okay.  Starting from the Buddha, when we look at the meditation instructions, for example in the Ana Panasati Sutra or the Saty Patana. We go for meditation.  in a place where we can withdraw from activity or so called secluded place. And although we are many here, when we settle for meditation, it means that for that time, this period of training. We do not have to deal with all  of what we were dealing before. So even if some of you have just been working in the kitchen, that's over now. All of what has been before is over.  And we arrive in this ungraspable now. This flowing experience.  And in the Mahmouder tradition, we start by opening all senses. So please, especially if you are drowsy, open your eyes. Don't, if you are drowsy, open your eyes very wide so that you can see the light from above. If you're not drowsy your K to meditate was close.  Open the Visual Sends and maybe if you're not so used to it, use a little point in front of your area where your eyes can rest without examining what you see, just resting somewhere. those who feel it is you can also lift the geyser.  more just as you are comfortable. The idea is to take in all the light which there is. To receive the light, not to close it out, to open up to the colors, just as you would do an activity. We have prepared.  adding for activity. Those of you who might feel uncomfortable with opening the eyes just open them from time to time and then close them again. Just try from time to time.  No straining on the eyes, just relax them as you would when looking into a beautiful metal with lots of flowers. We look into the distance and to a valley.  with a lot of sky, relax your eyes. The basic attitude is one of not clinging to anything. So we also don't have the idea that the eyes have to remain.  and absolutely still. By nature they are built in such a way that they oscillate a little bit. This gives them relaxation.  And do the same thing with the hearing. Open to all the hearing experiences. you  Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling the body, feeling all the physical sensations, you  So these are the so-called five outer senses, the body-based senses. you  Allow your attention to move in this field of 5 senses. holding on to anything. Just in the floor.  for very alive experience.  you  Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and an overall experience of our physical presence. you  And please also include now the six cents the awareness of what's going on in terms of thinking, feeling, how it is to be in the group, all of what is going on. you  you  We are not going anywhere special, just being fully present here, with all senses over. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  you  you  you  I have heard that all of you have already done the present you  retreats. So what we are practicing now is an open awareness with no clear support. The support for meditation is actually the flowing experience of all six senses.  And I guess you're familiar with looking into Anitra, the impermanence, the actually And here it is the changing nature, the ungraspirven nature of this ever changing now.  So let us be aware of just this quality of the present experience being so clear, yet Not definable.  This would be the Anata, the non-self of phenomena of all these experiences. is very nature of just...  small.  And take a rest. you  How about the ventilator? Is that needed? Let me say we try without. Okay. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.  walking meditation. Maybe a little word of how Leland I planned to work together.  Whenever I don't know how to continue, I pass the microphone over to her. Basically, she teaches me about how to teach in Israel. And the idea is that at times I would look over to you and say, And you, what would you say to this? And how does this fear?  to a person mainly trained in the Vipassana and so on, and then we can maybe establish a little bridge of understanding. Lila asked me to be the main teacher because I'm supposed to introduce something here to explain something this Mahamudra tradition. But now for the working meditation, I will say something a little bit later, you say a few words to that. And you use my...  So just a reminder, and maybe we can sort of combine, start into combine what we heard now with what we know about walking. But maybe I would stay with the pointer of just relaxing into each and every step.  So, also, founding the foundation, connecting to the earth, remembering we are walking under the pale light of the stars, which is such a gift to do, even right on the first day. and keep reminding ourselves. We can relax, rest and relax even during walking. This is the doing.  This is the action and the view is one of love and friendship. So step by step with that we let it grow in us. Very easy and relaxed way. So please enjoy walking. We will see you here at 9 o'clock.  for the final meditation of the day.",
    "45.mp3": " Dear friends, good morning. I've been a little bit late. There's a little request that to start the day, this day of change that we sing the T\u0101dha mantra together. And I'm really happy to share that with you because the T\u0101dha stands for this fearlessness. for  or a fearlessness that comes from wisdom and compassion. The wisdom is the deep understanding that there is no birth and death. That what we call the nature of mind is not born, it's not conditioned, and that it doesn't finish with the falling apart of this condition.  There is a stream of awareness which continues. And the message of this female Buddha called Tata is that we can all enter this basically fearless dimension, although there are many dangers and risks in the world. but basic  Basically the only thing that can happen to us is that we need to leave this body. And that's all. The practice continues. Practice continues all the time. And the basic practice, and again this is Tata. This is this compassionate resonance with everything and everybody. to continue no matter in which scene.  situation to continue with that wisdom to see the true nature of what happens, this ungraspable empty nature, and to maintain that resonance. Wherever there is a little opening to be there and to be of support, to be a catalyst in this beautiful process. So with this understanding, maybe we sing together. more time.  the Tadamantar.

I'm sorry.  Meditating with you I saw that there was a little bit hanging on to my Samadhi, and on to the stability of mind and then I realized that  It's a day of transition. Stronger transition than usual. Let that come on, get out of that. Say a few words. Maybe some of you may be some of you wait for a little encouragement of how to live this transition.  The way to prepare the transition could be that you see yourself how you walk, how you drive the car, how you enter the bus. you  How you meet your beloved ones, how you open your computer, look at your image, that you see yourself now. See yourself. There is something about you walking, which is more relaxed and more present than usual. I'm sorry.  You are not sharing completely the acceleration of life that is usually happening when you come out of the treat. And this is when you drive, it's not about getting somewhere quickly. When you read the image, it's not about...  Getting them done quickly. All of this, all of these meetings, these beings, they themselves are the practice. There's nothing to wait for afterwards. The steps we walk, how we sit down, how we drive, How we are in the bus.  we are with the people that we meet, then how we unpack our things, how we go back into communication, all of that is the practice. And the most important aspect there is our relationship with time. How do I relate to time?  Keep the practice of now, although we all will need to think about past, present, future, but keep that practice. Like you, I have a lot of tasks in my life. And just like you, I was often trying to speed up in order to do them all. I feel...  much better since I adopted an inner attitude. It's an attitude that I have time. People ask me, do you have time? I say, yes, I have time. They usually want me to do something for them. Oh, yes, I have time. But actually, maybe this is not my priority.  what you are asking of me. And I do my things with the feeling of having time. And that is this timeless dimension to being in time. So something I mean today I was late, but something which is also very helpful is...  Without being stressed, without being in a hurry, to be in places before the time, before the agreed time, to just be there and to hang around a little. And not waiting, it's not need to wait, you know, the person will also come in her time and his time.  But to take this as moments of practice, wherever we are, and when we are late, we are still on time. It is our time. That's the time we have. It's an attitude of life. It's really something where we can make a big change and really integrate our Oh, uh...  meditation practice with daily life. Not to do things quickly, quickly. If you haven't done it yet, if you will also pack your bags now and get together your things, that is serve is the practice. How to say goodbye to your room neighbor.  And so on, all of that is practice. And if the feeling to have time flows through everything, if that accompanies you, you always have the time for practice. If we live with a feeling that we do not have time, it will be difficult to find the time for practice. Okay.  Okay? Going to toilet is practice. Okay? Brushing the teeth is practice. You ask me what kind of practice? Oh, you're practice. Not mine. You, you, you have the time to feel, to, to, to direct your attention to what you like. You know, some people they like brushing teeth and look out of the window.  people, when the brush tees are like to be with the brushing. And so you do your practice, but that's all of that. This is our practice. There's nothing which is excluded. And with this beauty, you know, my life has changed a lot. And I have become less effective, efficient, I wanted to say. and  efficient means it looks like I'm doing a lot of things but always with the feeling of time and this is a big change. It also comes from the feeling that it is not me the eye that needs to do all these things that a me or I has to kind of finished the to-do list.  before I die. The day that I need to do this before I go to bed is similar to that. It's like, hey, to do lists, some of the things are really important, but most of them consider them as options. It's so options. And then always do what you fear is really most of you.  important. And with my to do lists, they solve themselves very often by the things that are not done to be understood as not so important. So they fall off. They fall off the list. And it's very natural in the in the in the life of a practitioner, those things which and really not imparting.  they don't have to be on our mind. So you will know for yourself how to deal with that. It's a lifelong learning. I would say that's taking me what's so many years and I'm still continuing. And this simplicity we talked about yesterday or I talked about yesterday. this is what I have  It's the same topic and it's our simple relationship to time. That will help a lot. If there you can bring in a feeling, I have time. Yes, I have used your time now to talk a little bit longer. You know, I don't care.  It was important. So, I took the pleasure to share something with you. But I can also stop now. Be happy in the transition.",
    "22.mp3": " Namo Buddha, namo Dharma, namo Sanga, namo Buddha, namo Dharma, namo Sanga. Namo Buddha, namo Dharma, namo Sanga. My Tibetan teachers would always add, But the Cheetah player and the 4 immeasurable, so in short, may our beings be happy.  It's right. Yes, and... Let me take a moment to say how I see the week in front of us. I've made a little comment this morning already. you  When I meditate with you, there is a great risk that I will say something. We have noticed this. And this is due to my dear teacher, Gennadun Pocchi, when he was still alive and I was starting to do, to offer meditation days in the monastery. So the laypeople from the surrounding, they could come and meditate with us. That means with me in that case.  And I was offering them the Stai, the Pasana, I was offering them great periods of silence and here there are some questions and answers and he came in. He was living next door, really, next door. Meditation hall, the temple would be here and that little room over there that would have been his apartment here. So he comes in, he looks to the door and observes and then he says, Lindrup, that's my Tibetan name. Lindrup, hund...  spontaneous one. It's spontaneously accomplished. That's what Lundrop means. And he calls me and says, Lundrum, you shouldn't let them sit like this. They just sit in the habitual patterns. They only sit in their kamik soup. There is nothing real happening there. You have to disturb their practice. You have to talk. And so with this instruction, why it was still alive?  I started talking meditation. And I learned over these years, now we are talking, I was at that time, 34 years, all the time, I'm 65, so I've been talking meditation for 30 years, right? Not all the time, but so the idea is yes. I appreciate your silent meditation, and I appreciate myself to be silent.  It is each time, you know, a little, yes, give me a little kick because I love to remain long periods in silence and the idea is to take you a little bit by the hand to guide you, not too close and not with too many big times of, you know, just letting you free. So, actually I am playing.  the role of sati in your practice. I play the role, the voice of the teacher, plays the role of what will be at home when you come home, will be your inner guru. The role of the outer guru is to train the inner guru. So your inner guru receives a training when listening to the outer guru, the outer The outer teacher shows you how to guide once on.  mind. So I speak for my practice. What I do is I always tell you what I have just practiced. I never tell you what we will, what I will practice together with you, but actually what I say is that which I have just practiced. And that's why it comes out pretty authentic because I speak from the experience of just now. Not something that is in my mind that what happened.  that which has just happened and then to some extent, not of course all, I communicated to you hopefully in a way that you don't feel too much manipulated, hopefully. I know it's a little bit sometimes disturbing and you might sometimes react with a little aversion, again, you know, he's again talking and again stirring up the silence.  and I was just feeling so good and now he comes again. He has another suggestion. But we will continue doing this. I will continue to bother you until the end of the retreat. Okay? This is my promise. Not all sessions. Not all. Okay, because I also don't like it so much to bother other people. But I feel it my sacred duty to do that. Yes, it's like I've seen it work.  over so many years with so many people. And I do know that it communicates very essential Dharma. It's really communicating to you how to do it. And then these audios which we have from discarded meditations, which here, our team, especially you see, and now I'm recording, then they will be at your disposition. You can listen to them again at home.  And you can always click on pause. Stop. Pause. Pause. And you stay with the effect of the instruction you have just meditated. And you deepen it a little bit, you repeat it to yourself. Yes. But like this, we accumulate quite a number of guided meditations for you, which are very practical instructions. Yes, and this is like my offering to you that you have.  know how to do instruction for at home, which you can listen to but please don't listen all the time. The idea is that you train your inner guru and then maybe you take some notes of what you hear in your own language. and then you put the audio aside and you guide your  yourself in a structured way. And then with the time, sometimes you listen to the audio a second or a third time, but please don't listen all the time. I've found people who have, they, like, lean back every day, they have the audio and they are guided through the meditation and it's super. The lama is guiding them through, but the inner guru is not getting stronger. So this will not help much when we die.  Right? Yes, we are preparing for times when we really need to master our mind. Yeah, and that's the time when it is really important. Everything else, I mean times of crisis are already important and especially times when your battery runs low. Yes, when you don't have any electricity, you need to be able to meditate without audios. and yeah, you have to be independent. So...  These guided meditations, I never know how I feel when I sit down, like last meditation a third now is very important to just keep silent and after half the time after half now I felt okay. Now is a good time to give you this key instruction, the six damas of Tilopa which I will explain in a minute. So it will be like...  is we try to find out what is the best from my little resonance, yeah, to of course, no absolute knowledge and it's never good for everybody. So there's always some people for whom it is not so perfect. And we will go like this, very much practicing, I'm done explanation of the practice which is also like helping your inner  to wake up because in the teaching when you receive the explanation of the practice you understand more and this understanding actually will be what guides you later on. It's not repeating the words of the teacher. This is, you're not being trained to be a parrot or something a dharma parrot, you know, it's not like this. It has to make sense to yourself. So from your own understanding, Due to listening, contemplating and...  the meditative experience, then your inner guru grows. And this process of the inner growth of the guru, in the Mahamudra tradition, goes until you have the first stable awakening. And the vipassana tradition, you would call this Sotapana, stream and so on. But it is a little bit more. The first bodhisattva boomi, it has to be stable. So that means the inner guru, we say, I'm sorry.  is awake when a person, a player yogi, yogini, when he or she has an emotion that by herself, she finds back into a direct understanding of the nature of mind. So it doesn't have to be in the emotion, but at least the same day, this capacity to be able to find back into a direct experience of awakening.  That's what we call the stable stream entry, the stable first bodhisattva empa. And only then can you say that your inner guru is sufficiently awake, so that you can do long stretches of your life without meeting the outer guru. Because you have now the developed capacity inside of you. makes total sense right it is like every good other training  If you want to make bread, then your chief baker, he tests you to make good bread. If you can produce good bread day after day after day, then you can open your own bakery. Yes, it's like this. It's the same with every. It's everything you learn. And here it's about entering the part of liberation and becoming independent.  of the outer inspirations, the outer guidance, the inspiration has to come from you, you have become a stable practitioner and whatever the challenges in your life, you can liberate the stress, you know how to find the way back into the source as I was calling it. Remember the source which is the basic nature, the grounds nature of our being without the nails. So this...  moments of touch down and the non-dual mind. It's a different expression for the same. So this is where we are going and this will not happen now in this course, yes, and this retreat, but we are going in that direction. So basically we are training you are in a wisdom. You're in a guru, you're in a wisdom, you're in an understanding and self-reliant. We're training and self-reliance.  And the further students go and self-reliance, you know, like if I take the example of guiding individual retreats, self-retreets, people come to me for self-retreets. And they don't have instructions every day. They have instructions once a week, sometimes twice a week. In the beginning, when people are not experienced in such self-retreets, I need to see them for personal interview if it's a short retreat, beginning, middle, and end. they get more XP.  even if they do two weeks of retreat and I see beginning with them only three times. But over the time, my more experienced students, I speak with them about their practice only once every three months or something. They have become very self-reliant, they have a good understanding of the Dharma. They can rely on that and they know when to see me. They know when it becomes a little difficult and not quite true.  or how to handle the present challenges, the development, and then they need to see the teacher for one-on-one interview, one-on-one talk. They all have the written Dharma or the audio Dharma available all the time. So to check with the written Dharma or audio talks, This can happen anytime and most...  practitioners, they do it every day to read a little bit of Dharma, one paragraph, one page, you know, just to have a little stimulation for their practice. So this is basically the way Mahamudra is communicated and it's pretty much the same in other traditions, only that some traditions, they don't do much personal guidance, which and the memory.  tradition is very important. And here seemingly you have a good tradition, a good practice of personal guidance. This is something I appreciate very much in Tovana, it's very nice to see, it's very well established. Now this book which I brought you now, this blue Bible is called Mahamudra, the ocean of true meaning, or could also be the definite meaning, the reliver, the true meaning,  So this is written by the 9th Kamapa and the 16th century. The 9th Kamapa is the first one in Tibetan history who has manifested this capacity to predict his own reincarnation. So half of them, We are now with the seventeenths. Half of them have even left a letter telling exactly family and plays  where they are going to be reborn. Others have given all the instructions, some have not left any instructions. They're very great masters, so you can say, we have mastered birth and death to such an extent that they can even predict where their mind stream will manifest again. Very capable masters. Here's, and they are said to be the continuation of Kudur Rinpoche, the Bhatmasambhava, who predicted that his, that's on the back.  Guren Brijji was the one who brought the Dharma from India to Tibet. Others helped. There were two other great masters who started that, but when difficulties arose, they called their master Padmasambhava who came and anchored the Dharma and Tibet in the first wave of transmission. and he predicted that in the future  There will be a continuation of his activity for 21 incarnations under the name of Kamapa. And we are now at the 17th. And then the activity will change. And he gave the names for each one of them and so on. It's like a wonderful thing, how they take care of humanity. Yes, it's incredible. This is Bodhisattva work. the real Buddhist Advaitess, you know, one coming.  back again and again no matter how difficult the situation is. The sixteenths come up, I went with the dialogue alarmer together to see Mao Zedong to see what they can do in order to avoid war and so on. In very difficult times and they had to both leave the country and continued to work in northern India and in the world and so on and so on. lots of things to say. Very reliable Mahamudra instructions.  And this book was written in Tibetan, of course, Tibetan block print for Lamas. So for people like myself, and this book teaches Lamas how to teach their students in Mahamudra. This was the original idea of this book. And it takes us through the preliminaries, the four thoughts which turned the man towards him.  Dharma is for general preliminaries, then the for special preliminaries with the frustrations, the purification, mantra practice, the mandala offering, the Guru Yoga, then the for specific requisites in order to achieve realization, whether these four necessary conditions to realize the nature of mind. And then after that, after these three types of preliminaries.  Then it goes into the explanation of the general points on body and mind, something which is to be respected for all practice, followed by explanation of the shamata practice, kam abiding, intuitive insight, repassana practice, and then how to deepen the insight of repassana in Mahamudra practice, how to overcome obstacles, how to...  to dissolve misunderstandings in the practice of insight, you know, and giving some additional instructions how to enhance the practice. Once you have entered the first bodhisattva stage, the path of seeing, here, the, this first bodhisattva boomi, how to continue, then, until you reach an always wider awakening. So.  This book was the one where Gennadiyan Phrachi said, I mentioned it in the other group, they which was leaving. This book wasn't translated. And when I was in retreat, I was together with Henrik and Vali, who spoke Tibetan fluently. And Gennadiyan Phrachi asked them to give this book, to make a translation for us, for me and my Dan Wife, X-Wine.  Yadena, Lama Yadena, she is still a Buddhist man. And so we received the first translation of this book in pencil writing. And every lesson in this book, we needed to realize the meaning of that chapter, of that lesson, before we received the next lesson. and the beginning it went quite smoothly.  We practiced and we understood we received the next lesson, but I tell you there was a place in the inside section. We got stuck for seven months. We just didn't get the point of what was the inside to reach in that part of the instructions. And then after that was master, then we received further instructions. And later on, General Rampantjee wanted this to be published and then  It was them that he said, this Mahamudra teaching has to reach the ends of the globe. And he said, even to South Africa, it was the first point he could think of. Yes? So his idea was that everybody who has the karma, the merit, to understand Deep Dharma should have the possibility to have access to this. And it's available.  on the internet, that's the English and the German. Here I brought you the English version. And although there are passages in there which are only meant for for llamas who are teaching, but you will probably, those of you who are motivated, like you said in the group that you are very motivated, this would be the kind of book to look into, but you need then to listen to the audios. It is this book that I explained.  Brazil and Greece in seven years it takes seven years to go through the whole book seven years of two weeks of teaching and this is more teaching than what we do here. So it's already a lot what we do here, but it's more hours of teaching right there, something like five hours or six hours or something like this. So just to tell you, this is what our teacher Gennadrympotry among other texts, but we went...  through with him, I was following inti-bat and when he was teaching and he was explaining every sentence to us and you know and then we took our notes and so on and we went through this whole text and this was you can say the backbone of the three year we treat was to understand this text. This is a clear Mahamudra transmission and you need to receive it from someone who holds you  that transmission, what can read it, but one will not understand everything, but one can take a lot of inspiration. And now I conclude my long explanation. The six damas of Tilopa are found in here. Okay? Yes, the six damas of Tilopa are part of that general section on the key points So  on the mind. And it starts in lesson 22, continues in lesson 23. So this is on the pages 123 following. I have a new book here which I bought just before coming to Greece because the other one was falling apart. I was using it so much and I make a little notch here.  on the page, yes, so that you can find, when I leave it here, you can find the right page easily with the instructions of the Six Damas of Tilopa. And now I will give them again. Tillopa. Tillopa, yes. Tillopa was an Indian master and his main student was another time.  who was before he met Tiloper, he was one of the four main scholars, the four abbots of the Nalanda University. The Buddhist University of Nalanda in the 11th century had around 100,000 students. It was enormous. Just imagined the the  logistics of how to find water and how to provide toilets for all these people. Just think of that in those times. It was an incredible seat of learning and now Roper was one of the four heads of this monastery and extremely learned. Now his intuition told him that he hadn't really understood. He was so learned and... So  somehow this emanation of Buddha like Tara appeared in the form of a crooked lady with a hunchback. When he was studying in the garden, then another part, where he was studying his text, then this crooked lady, old lady came and said, do you understand what you are reading? Naropa lukte.  her and said, I understand the words, but do you understand the meaning?\" And he was so sincere, he said, no, not really. And it was due to that manifestation of this female, then the lady dissolved into light and it wasn't seen anymore. then due to that moment of being checked on by the Buddhas, he realized...  that all his learning wasn't enough. And he had a dream and so on and he went to search for this Tilopa. An outrageous story about Tilopa but anyhow he found him and some of you have heard this wonderful Ganges Mahamudra, the song of realization of Tilopa, at the Ganges when he teaches Naropa and and give the key answer.  abstractions of Mahamudra. It's a little bit longer. It's not a long text, but it's on a few pages, but very profound. This partane is sung. And Naropa was the teacher of Mahapra, the first Tibetan in this lineage. Here's and Mahapra brought it then back to Tibet. And his students are then the beginning of this lineage from which I'm talking. Okay, so just to give you a little ID.  here in where we are at. So again, Tilopa talks to Naropa, and he gives him key instructions on meditation, so to speak. Do not reflect on the past. Do not anticipate the future. Do Do not think about the present, do not analyze, do not meditate, leave the mind naturally.  as it is. So these six instructions have become a good way to show the Mahamudra and approach, which is not pretending that we can do anything to realize the nature of mind. Whatever we do with effort.  will remain in the realm of samsara. So, how do we go about this? First, I need to explain each of the six sentences, and then we have a look at how it is, the whole thing together. When the Khamapa sets out to explain this, and he quotes other teachers like Kampobar, Kwatsangpa, and so on, And then he says, well, actually, Mahamudra,  does not depend on cutting through the thinking about the three times past, present, future. Actually, Mahamudra does not need to stop the thinking process. This is normally not necessary, because you can realize the nature of the thinking process to be the nature of mind. However, if beginners are not...  to stop thinking about past, present and future, then their mind will never become clear enough to see the true nature of what is going on. So we must tell beginners to stop all this cogitation, all this thinking about what usually goes on in their life. And we must make it clear, this is the first process of understanding.  that the past does not exist. You can think about the recent events in the Middle East, but you are just making a present thought. The past is gone. Okay? Very clear. You might have lost friends, acquaintances, might have lost dear people. All of that is...  Past. Okay? Very clear. The past is only here as a present. We bring the past alive all the time with our thinking process. We make it into a new present. The present changes the past. It's not the past. We are not reliving the past. We are living a present moment where our beautiful Remember.  of childhood to think of something else. You know, we have beautiful memories. The beautiful memories are also past, and they become present now by the way we like to think about the beautiful moments of our childhood. They are just an enjoyable entertainment in the present moment. And we think about the past, but we don't think about the past. There's no past to think about. Big gift.  life to ideas that we project into a past, but actually they are present. And they are very active in us. So actually we are just in that moment creating karma. We are in that moment actively producing something in our mind, which will have further consequences. The more we indulge in it, the more it will grow. And will become stronger.  So one thing in meditation is when we meditate, I'm not talking about normal life, we need to learn from our mistakes from the past, we need to learn from history, it's very important. We need to, you know, the past is an object of reflection and we need to learn many lessons from it. So not to repeat the errors and to rather learn from the good things of the past. and in met.  This is not the point to reflect about it because this would be constructive thinking. Constructive thinking is to reflect about the past, it's a contemplation. We can sit down, we can reflect about the past, we can take a book, we can take notes, we can talk with someone. It's a different activity. In meditation, We need to step out of the identification with the software.  called past, which is the karma of now that we are producing. Every time that I think that I'm still the chairman of yesterday, the chairman of ten years ago, or like I just mentioned some events, thirty years ago, you know, hey, this is an illusion. This is an illusion. I can't even find the chairman of now. How about the chairman of the...  This is just a good story. Okay? So stop dwelling on stories. Be radical about that. Cut, the thinking about the past, because it's not an object of reflection. It doesn't exist. It's a production of the present. Okay? So this is very important. In meditation, please do not reproduce the past. and please  don't believe that it is the past that is coming back. It is the present that arises due to conditioning in similar images that remember, that remind you of the past. It's very important to be clear about that. Now the same thing goes for the future. We all know without thinking about the future, we will not be able to make provisions for the winter, we will have nothing I'm going to go back in.  fridge we would have, you know, it's like we can't work. We have to make plants. And a good mother makes plants for the whole family. A good mother, and she better is, is, is, in Tibetan culture. A good mother is someone when an unexpected visitor comes and everybody thinks, but we have nothing to offer. She always has a place from where she can manifest magically yet another soup.  Yet another something to share with the guests, that's because she anticipates. Yes, she anticipates the future. So, anticipating the future and making good plans for it, this is a very constructive, very necessary activity in our normal life. But in meditation, we learn to disidentify also with all our projects, all our ideas about the future because then  We put on really the strong light of insight and we see it's mere speculation. What the future will bring, whether it will bring war or paradise, we don't know. This is just likely it will bring one or the other. And our cleaning to our ideas on the so-called future is actually from the point of view of of meditation.  just another scenario of ego-clinging. It's one of the favorite projections of mind to dwell on what will be after the retreat. What will I do with my life? How will I give meaning? When will I be finally enlightened? What will I do after enlightenment? You know, it's like, yes, all of these questions have already heard. or the hurt.  in which it feeds and it's just complete destruction. It is in the meditation, only destruction. It is the play of egocentric bucksharks which are anti-battern, this means habitual tendencies. That's the habitual tendencies of being preoccupied with the future, just as we are preoccupied with the past. So, then the third time, the third time is the present.  We talk so much about the present and being in the present. It is difficult to find the present. It is very difficult. The moment I say present, that word is already gone. It's only a memory now. The memory is in the present, but the word is in the past. You know, it's always, we are always too late. to really catch the...  is impossible because the moment we try to grasp it has changed already. So, don't even try. The radical meditation instruction is, do not think about the present. And now, for those of you who have encountered some good teaching to label the present, For example, to say thinking when you think or to say pride.  You have pride, or to say, you know, this labeling practices, they are very good because they create this identification. You see what's going on and because of labeling it, you don't identify so much with it. But from the point of view of Mahmoudra practice, you are behind. This has already happened. The moment you saw it, you don't need to label it anymore. Because you already saw it, it's gone. The left.  labeling always comes too late. Okay? So don't even think about the present. Don't think if the present is fine or not so fine and just experience it. Just be. And this being is this what I describe to you. This is where I spend so much time describing to you the five aspects of time. and this timeless means of  Always there, in a way it's eternal, but also timeless, cannot be caught. There's always this spaciousness, there's always the fluidity, there's always the ungrasp of the nature, there is the lucidity and there is the creativity. It's always there. You become familiar with that and you will see it working in the now, but you will never be able to grasp it. So, noted.  think about the present is saying don't try to grasp the present. It's the same instruction. Here's thinking as a form of grasping. Thinking here in this context is a form of trying to solidify the present. So stop solidifying the present experience of now. So the present, And as a thing cannot be found. Now a flowing experience.  in the now, yes, can be clearly experienced. And all the more so, if there is no clinging, than the experience of this very vivid now becomes all encompassing, all pervading. There's nothing more than that. And that's when it becomes timeless. Then timeless means we don't even compare with past anymore. you  A timeless means we don't even see the change. We are the change, we don't see the change. Timeless means that we even stop comparing with what was before with the last breath. We are so much in the now we don't care about the last breath. We don't care about the last moment of experience, we are completely present. So this idea of impermanence and change.  is a very relative one. What we can say is that any observing mind just finds it impossible to grasp, to describe the qualities of the now. Every attempt at describing the now fails because the now has so many facets, so many aspects that we live.  Like right now, it's happening now, I'm talking about now. It's happening now, all the facets of what we live now. Even if we had hours to describe it, we couldn't describe it. There's so many new subtleties to this experience. So keep silent concerning the now.  No comments. Just leave it, be it. Then come two more instructions. Do not analyze. Now, this is one of the wonderful preoccupations of meditators. They wait for the first Bumi and the Hanoi, first Jhana, the second Jhana, and so on, and they analyze whether it's really empty or not, or whether and so on.  All these wonderful analysis of the meditator, you know? Is this really now the perfect moment? You know, this kind of question, you know, this is analysis. Is this liberation? The moment you have such thoughts, it's definitely not it. Okay, this is one thing for sure. the Mahmoudra instructions they are very ready ready a lot of this part.  Stop analyzing, don't use analysis, which was so useful before it had so much, from the ordinary point of thinking it's very good to know where you are on the path and how you will look into your meditation and what is your hindrance and what you can improve and with remedies to apply. All of that is very helpful, same as anticipating the future and learning from the past. you  It is very helpful to analyze. But when you really come to the point of practice of how to enter realization, you have to stop. What's all that? We have to stop that analyzing. So basically it means stop caring, whether you have a good meditation or a bad meditation. Just be. because the moment you cared it's definitely a bad-mended hair.  You understand? It's like, yes, good that you love. I'm happy that you get that sense of humor which is in there. Because they were all laughing the heads of every Mahamudra Master giving these instructions of course, laughing his heads off because it's cutting through all the habitual tendencies. It's exactly what we are doing all the time and it It is dead, which obstructs awakening. In awakening we have to...  forget ourselves. We have to really completely forget that someone is meditating. And this is the fifth instruction, do not meditate. Meditation in that sense, when we say do not meditate, means anything artificial, do not fabricate a meditation, do not fabricate a meditation on love, a meditation on emptiness, a meditation on dukkha, on knit.  whatever is your preferred thing, you know, don't fabricate a Janna experience, you know, let it be. That's the sixth one. Leave the mind natural means leave it up to surprise. There's no definition what natural is. Leave it as it is. When you respect the f-  first ones. The sixth one will be obvious, it will be that which is left. And that's why I find although one says in modern, in modern, Neuro-psychology one says the mind doesn't understand knows, here, do not do not but one understands very well actually. One understands very well actually.  very well that this is not helpful. And actually when one understands, one drops thinking about the past and the future and so on, like a famous hot potato, not to get burned, like you pull out something from the hot sand, you know, you have been baking something in the hot sand, you know, you drop it, you know, you leave it. If you don't, and...  You understand? You still play around with it? And you will be well entertained in your meditation. Okay. Until you understand. Huh? We should say the sixth in Hebrew. Lila, would you be so kind? and please take the microphone.  form. Maybe you have yours in yes. Of course. No, no, it's for the recording. Yes, the important things should all go under recording. Yes. So,  So 6 of the diamonds that I got. So the reason is not to be in the air, because I'm not going to be in the air, I'm not going to put it on the air. The key is not to get into the air. Don't forget to put it on the air, as you can see from the outside. Okay. The key is not to get into the air. I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy, I was so happy  I don't think about it. The 50th, it's not a meditator, it's a mental health. It's a way to think about what I'm doing, and to think about it, and to think about the way I'm doing it, I'm a doctor's doctor. I'm not a doctor's doctor, I see. She is a  Now please to do me a favour and then a favour goes through a game and give a little bit more explanations. You can repeat the explanation. Sure. Better. You can repeat the exact same thing. You can repeat the exact same thing. You can repeat the exact same thing.  So you can be an explanation or you can repeat some of the explanations which I have given. Because it's so important, make sure that they are all understood. And then I'll do it in Tibetans. Okay, so the reason is not to be angry or to be afraid and not to be angry.  and we are very happy and happy with what we have done in our lives. This is the habit of the child, the habit of the child, the pride of our mind, to have a lesson, to learn the laws, to teach the lesson of the last lesson in the next lesson. Avar, Avar, Neigmar, Lachzorotter, the colonist.  This is the result of our replay. We have the tapes that are on the screen. We are rewired. Rewined. Ifshar. Not possible for the person. This is a story. The story is that it is a very good story to the extent of the story. All the stories of the world, the world, the world, the world. I wanted to tell you that this story is a story. This story is all about the story. The linearity of this story. We are in a very different world. The best.  We are not going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going to let it go, we are going  the present. So, we are talking about the present moment, present moment. What is the rule? How long does it take to get the rule? The reason is that it is a very common reason. The reason is that it is a very common reason. And why I am telling you this is a very common reason. Because we are talking about the rule, it is because we are talking about the rule. We are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. The rule is that we are talking about the rule. I'm going to have to go back.  if you are not in the mood to do it. If you don't have a job, so there is a lot of different rules, and we have to choose the rules. So, we have two rules, two rules of the law, you know? And what is the rules of the rules? There is the rules. It's the rules that I fear in them. The rules that we often say are wrong, or are not in a certain way. The machine is car...  and when we think about the fact that we are going to have a good time, we are going to have a good time and we are going to have a good time. We are going to have a good time, a good time and a good time and a good time and a good time and a good time. We are going to have a good time and a good time and a good time and a good time and a good time and a good time. We are going to have a good time and a good time and a good time and a good time and a good time and a good time. and I'll reveal him to be able to analyze love.  So I'm like mixing our go with this. So it's like not to go into the drill. You got me, right? I should do.  We have to have a good relationship with our own people. To me, this is a very important thing. We have to be strong, we have to be strong, we have to be strong. This is a very important thing for us. To be strong, to be strong, to be strong. But what we do is we are very strong. This is a very simple idea. This idea is what is the most important thing in the military. And we have a very simple idea.  We have a great family, we have a great family, we have a great family, we have a great family, We are not going to be able to express ourselves. We have a lot of people, people who are in love with us, and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid and we are afraid  That's it. The mediterate who is here, yalla, full power. So, the way you analyze the story of our story, you choice them back. So, you can tell them how to make a story. For the people who are from us, they are not like us. They are like the people of our country. And when that story, The next time I see the 50th of this...  This is a very specific order. For example, we have a gender, a gender-like structure, a gender-like structure, a gender-like structure, a gender-like structure, a gender-like structure, we are in this way. We have a very simple order, we are all in a very simple order, a very simple order, a very simple order, but it is very easy to make. We have a very simple order, I'm going to put it on the back.  and I am going to take a look at the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of  that we can see in all the details. So, we can see the difference between the live-demand and the actual. So, it's a very good thing to see live-the-room. It's a very different story, but as for the difference between the common and often-famous, it's like a blind eye. Not a blind eye. Not a blind eye. It's like a blind eye, or a blind eye. But I can't go to the beginning.  So, it's not like we're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. We're talking about the same thing. Oh, I'm sorry.  Thank you so much.  Isn't that wonderful? I can have a rest, she talks. I feel the same, most of the time. And I've noticed by the notes which you have written that some of you at least with the written English are not so much at ease and yet, and still you are here in the course. you  Maybe from time to time we can do like this, that Lila makes an improvisation on the same, the same team, and you can hear a second teaching with similar contents. Yes, it is maybe I saw some of you came more to life, you could understand more directly. It is something very special to be able to receive the Dharma in one's mother-time. Yeah, it's like he didn't get  directly in your own language and cause deeper. So, and to hear the two times it goes even deeper. So we will see about that. I will hopefully feel that some passages can be done twice. That is, never, it's never a loss of time. It's always wonderful. So now, no, no, I shouldn't have said time because in my panoramic view.  I saw that Lila is immediately looking at the clock, but I am very much aware. And there is something new which we tell you after the dedication. We will make a dedication. You know, there is no teaching without the dedication normally. I am making adjustments with the situation here, but normally there is very beautiful digital in the beginning and the dedication at the end. I'm sorry.  So let's dedicate all the joy of this teaching or the understanding of this teaching. Let's with a deep outlet dedicate that to the awakening of all. And then of course resting in the understanding that nobody was dedicating anything.  That may be in Tibet and he blew you up to say. Yes, you can just this. This is need to be translated somewhere. Got the point, nobody dedicated.  anything. It's a good thing to do.",
    "37.mp3": " Here we are again. Happy Buddha, happy Dharma, happy Sangha.  Let's be thin and hard with that wonderful care of ourselves. it in the whole body.  This Palace of Timeless Awareness, the potential Palace of Timeless Awareness, if you want.  I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay.  We sit in all that simplicity. you  So, although we are going to do a tongue-land practice, we know that basically there's nothing to do. This doesn't really change. that simplicity, this ground of our being.  We are live, manifest, so to speak, by itself. Causes and conditions continuously creating the new now. you  And so simple, mind is actually a relaxed mind is actually by itself aware. Even there we don't have to do something. It just relax all those tensions that create waves and lack of awareness.  mind by nature, this is awareness, this is conscious, this is seeing. So everything arises by itself, being aware, living the experience of life happens by itself, and it even disappears by itself.  It dissolves into the next experience, all by itself. Well, if all of that happens by itself, what am I needed for? Pingo, you are not needed.  Relax.  Who will practice if I don't practice?  you  Let's put it like that. The very confused, clinging to a self created a big mess. The less confused, clinging to self which has listened to some Dharma is cleaning up the mess. It's a lowing.  For all those accumulated tendencies of suffering to create suffering to dissolve. This is, you can say, the wise, compassionate self, still in the dualistic world. working with subject and object which is fine as fine.  It's already not creating such a mess anymore, but actually helping the process to become clearer. And then this notion of the practitioner, the Yogyini, the Yogin, Even this notion deserves more.  So often we notice that practice has happened for a while without anyone doing anything.  I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to put it on.  And now we ask these wise compassionate forces of Sati to connect ourselves for the why I was to breathing experience.  And this wise compassionate awareness is fully open to whatever aligns. I'm sorry.  So open that it doesn't even click. This is the space of our...  mind, visualise, like a sphere of light very big and actually when we go into it it is limitless.  Already this is so beautiful. in this compassionate sati.  compassionate mindfulness. Litting it all, dissolve, and waste them. And breathing out with loving sati, loving mindfulness.  Basically, this is what is anyhow happening in an awakened mind. There would be nothing to train if we already were naturally in that awakened state. you  And now into this very open mind, into this very open experience of life breathing in and breathing out, we invite someone whom we love. Take someone where you have no hesitations with  the feeling of love is really the dominant force. This person doesn't have to be alive and it can also be an animal. It sounds strange when I say an animal. Yeah, tap.  They have character. choose one person and please during the exercise don't  Change the person, stay with one. And try to remember when you last met this person.  Even if it is longer ago, the last meeting, to make it more precise, not the overall person, but just your memories of that encounter. Try to fear  the mixture of feelings that this person might have experienced. Breathing in and breathing out as if we work quietly listening.  to the heart, mind, of the other person. We know quite a bit about her, about him. And we have some intuitions of what?  was probably going on. And now comes something very important for the Tom Lamp Practice. You will also feel many positive feelings. There will be warm feelings. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  only Dukha. So within all the different shades of feelings that you can contact. Not making a difference between them. But they are different in the sense they are like the colors of a rainbow.  different levels of modes of views, attitudes, emotional states. Like when you have...  ice cream of different colors. Not completely mixed yet. So tastes how possibly that person could have felt. Shortly, different tastes of that experience.  We are breathing it in, letting it liberate itself, which means for us a moment of letting go and then with the out breath.  some love, some joy, some support. You know those different layers of experience, one after the other. And when there is no need for support, just offer your understanding. Test over your M  in the best sense of the world. You are feeling with that your deep understanding.  And then imagine that this support is received. And now the situation changes. It's not the situation that we have lived anymore. It's a new one. I hope you enjoyed this video.  person receives the deep understanding that loving support that wisdom. And we see it becoming more radiant. We see her or him.  becoming more radiant as if the Buddha nature was to shine through. And of course for those of your worth creative minds, then the person would also behave and speak differently.  And then in the next round we open up to everything that still clouds the heart mind of that person in our perception. What could still be a hindrance to all of its qualities, her all of his qualities to I'm sorry.  And we breathe that in symbolically speaking we open up, we become completely aware of that. As if these vales, these handlances were our own.  If we don't well on them, we allow them to dissolve in that big space.  And we visualized that all these waves that we felt are gone and the person radiates even more with her or his natural qualities.  you  And you continue like that until you can see the person with this Buddha nature. you  you  We can see the beauty, perhaps a beauty that was hidden to our eyes before.  And to finish that sequence, we offer our appreciation, our joy in that beauty. We offer it back to that person.  our gratitude, our love, and then of course the image dissolves into that great space where that has come from.  you  And again, Self-horizing appearances, Self-aware mind, Self-verting. you  I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. you  Can we make a little pause because we just love pauses?  If anyone needs to go to toilet, this is also possible.  It feels to me like this was quite a safe way to do the practice, huh? Very safe. what made it so safe also is that which...  a person that we love so much, where there is dominantly positive feelings. And what it makes it so safe also is that we have this strong awareness that we are working with our own mind. And this is what sometimes people forget when their practice is tumbling. forget their working with their own mind.  their own ideas about other people. But these ideas are not so wrong, okay? They are not so wrong. But they are simply one aspect, you know, one of the many facets how this person can be perceived. And the tongue-ring practice opens our eyes the eyes  which are in the heart, you know, the Dharma eyes, opens these Dharma eyes to be able to see the full potential of the other person. And the miracle is that we can see that because actually we are also in touch with our own potential. We can only see in the other person, but we can only also see in ourselves.  And the beauty you saw, if you saw some beauty, is a mirror of your own beauty. Okay? This is how beautiful you are. Your own basic nature is like that. So this process of Tonglin, whether we work with ourselves, or whether we work with others, is always a process of working with oneself.  No matter what the content is, and it changes our relationship with ourselves and with the so-called world. Then when you, I mean, it's these tongue-led instructions are pretty well known in the Buddhist world right now, you find them in quite a few books. and the...  readers, they usually get very well this idea of taking, of receiving and then of giving, of sharing, receiving energy. This idea is usually very well received, everyone understands that. However, they tend to forget the two phases in between. This is where the practice can go wrong.  If you forget that in the taking, in the receiving, there is this open space in which everything dissolves, then you are still insolidifying the experience. You think, you believe somehow because this is our natural tendency that we are taking in something that could make us maybe sick or that could  like make a suffocate or you know like all these reactions to our own projection of taking is happening because this knowing the true nature of the appearances, the self liberating the empty nature, the changing nature, this is not enough there. So in all the texts on Tonglin, other commentators on this practice.  They all insist that we need the ultimate bodhicitta, which is this understanding of the empty nature, the self-liver-latined nature, that this must be a preliminary to the practice of the relative bodhicitta, which is this practice of compassion and loving care. We enter the relative world, so to speak, with an understanding of its true nature.  And then the things become easy. So this is the first part which is usually left out. By many practitioners they love to take, somehow it's their savior attitude, their savior gene which is like me saving the world and their take, has very much ego in the taking. And to some degree it feels great, Because then we have a great company.  but there's also some arrogance in the practice. There is like, I take you are free, I support you, you are better. It's like, we don't want to engage in that. That's the use with some Sada. This is not what is the healing practice. So, never get into that. When you feel that's in a subtle way, that you are not on eye level with the person that you're working with, your working with it.  and your imagination, collect your attitude. We are not doing something which is extremely beneficial for the other person, like offering the greatest service and so on. We're actually healing ourselves. We're actually getting out of our weird, very limiting conceptions about how others are. We are taking them out of the prison of our...  projections. It's a high time to do that, you know? So it's like the least thing we can do. And this is very important and it will be so easy if we see that actually we are working with our own world, but in our own world, the person that we have been working with in our own perception Indeed she changes. You don't believe how often...  I have worked with my mother. I was doing it again now and yet my perception of her changed. Still, after all these years, hundreds of times that I have been working with my mother. And I was encountering her in my imagination the night before she died. And it was, and That is because...  understand the practice more deeply now, that I could give myself the encouragement to see more layers, more facets of her being, and then to go more completely in the second aspect that is usually forgotten at the end of the outburst, at the end of the support, to see the change in the other person, how that is received and how the Buddha nature shines through. and you don't find that...  So often in the descriptions that you read, even in the descriptions or in the teachings, it is often missing. It is a very important notion of Tonland, because if we only breathe in and then as we breathe out and give the support, and then we think the person hasn't changed, actually we are solidifying suffering. We are solidifying the habitual patterns.  in our perception of the other person, as if the other person is inculable. But he is not, or he is not inculable, it's only that our perception of the other person is very obstinate. There's a lot of fixation there, we don't want the other person to truly reveal It's...  potential. We hold on. We hold on to our way of seeing that person. And this will become very important when we work with a person, who has harmed us. And where we were, the victor, we will not do that. Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry. Yeah, but that is an option where we can go but we never force ourselves. Here's so when there has been some  harm and we have actually suffered. Then it's part of our identity. And it's very difficult to see the Buddha nature and the other person. And it is one way of solidifying reality. That we never release the other person, even for a moment from what has occurred years ago. Yeah.  So we are ourselves stuck in a prison of seeing the person only like that. So it's a very important part of the practice that after giving the loving support, that we see the transformation, and yes, we admit that maybe it's not on the first goal, that the full transformation is there.  we look for the remaining layers, we look for the remaining layers. And we have a second goal. But after doing the second goal, you don't have to do so many more. You know, it's like, take it easy. Take it easy. Yes. but develop and always deeper recognition of the one.  for qualities in the people that you are thinking of because that's basically what we are doing. Basically we are doing that. Now an example from the animal realm could really help us here. I'm just coming for the retreat in Greece and one of our participants. She adopted a puppy, Yeah.  dog seven years ago when we were also in Greece and one of our members of the group found this puppy almost dying completely full with lies and no mother inside and we took as a group care of this puppy cleansing, I took the lies of found something to eat and drink and she adopted this puppy at the time.  this puppy turns out to be an incredible big dog, a male dog and so far not castrated and very sharp after the other male dogs. And also a little bit unruly and very difficult to teach. But Garwan, that's the name I gave the dog a Tibetan name. We made a little refuge ceremony for the dog. So, it does.  r1 means the powerful dancer. And at that time when he was a puppy I didn't know what kind of dog that would be but we already saw that energy. So the energy of the powerful dancer was in the room. Now in this retreat though our powerful dancer, Garwan, he loves to eat the shit which other dogs leave for other any emulsion.  snatches his away and then he brought it under the table and and was kind of chewing away at it. It was a little bit dry. And and Poppy, the owner, she tried to distract him and with the other hand, she tried to snatch away that wonderful something. And he saw it and didn't realize it was her hand a bit.  Now look, we have a situation where he beloved one, she loves that dog, it's a very difficult dog. She went to many trainings, nothing works, you know? And a little bit like us, many retreats, but small learning. Yes? So of course this dog when realizing that he had just bitten her.  was completely sad. For one day he was disturbed and just was walking around like this, you know, very feeling guilty and so on. And this is an example, a simple example of someone in a loving relationship doing harm because of habitual tendency, doing harm to someone as even regretting it.  And then you see the harm and everyone was talking about having to castrate that dog and so on, you know? And yes and now we are not so much in favor in this kind of manipulation, but maybe who knows? But we needed an everyone because he's part of the group. We knew that beautiful Buddha nature of that difficult dog. So the group N.  the owner didn't mind. But of course, the owner of the house where we were, minded a lot and got very worried about what would happen and so on. And this is a very interesting how the more we know the qualities of someone difficult. Now I'm talking again about humans. The more written are the quote  qualities of someone difficult. The more skillful we are in dealing with the difficult aspects, let's call them challenging aspects. Those habitual patterns that other people cannot deal with at all, it's just too much, there's too much rejection of that. And then because we're in contact with those qualities, that is one strong point and it helps us so much to deal with the challenging signs. inside.  Now imagine that you had done meditations with yourself, working with your own aggressive instincts, your own aggressive reactions. Oh my God, I was in fifth or sixth year of retreat, only practicing Bodhichitta, day and night, Mahmoudra, and a headed dream, in which I was defending our village in northern it.  I was defending it with a machine gun. And in my dream, I was shooting everyone who came. I woke up shocked. I woke up so shocked that this was in me, a Buddhist monk. And of course, I was not unfamiliar with my own aggressivity and possible violence. But this was the strongest I had lived so far. And I took a  But as if it were real, I practiced with it. And it helped me so much to understand others who have feelings like that, reactions like that. So much, so much understanding. I know it's not this solution, but at least I understand it. So now combine the two. Combine that you're able to see the Buddha nature, the qualities. you have worked with your own  challenging sides, let's call them nicely, challenging sides, those aspects of us challenging to others and to ourselves. Most of us have an affluence of them, lots of them, as many as we have qualities. So we have worked with both, and this gives a great capacity to be helpful in situations, because we don't resist.  as much as before, the challenging sides, and we are much more in contact with the qualities, and we have learned how to nourish those qualities. And this is what the Tongue and Practice is for. Continuously imagining how we nourish those qualities, how they appear, what are the the challenging aspects, the wails which remain, except...  not refusing them, allowing them to come fully into our awareness and then not fighting with them, letting them dissolve by themselves, so allowing ourselves not to cling to them and just be. There is an after-resonance. The residence doesn't stop just because they're self-liberation. Self-liberation. This is something you should know. Self-liberation doesn't mean  that our Resonance stops because the Self-Livitation, when that is full seeing and then the Self-Livitation, it leaves an understanding. It leaves the seeing, we have seen. What we have felt and seen is not forgotten. It is there. These are traces of understanding which will continue in our current in our mind stream. Yes?  And from these understandings, then comes the movement of support. Okay? So this was again an explanation of the full cycle of the tongue-limpracters. So that we each time understand it a little bit deeper. I'm very happy to be able to share that with you.  I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing.

I mean, it will be just a visual representation of something which cannot actually be captured by drawing. It will look like a circle, but maybe for you is up and down, or maybe it's in and out, or maybe it's expanding and contracting, you know, whatever you are way of seeing it. Yeah? Okay.  And like I was singing in the morning, the longer opening prayers, I was you  Now the longer closing prayers are sent to me. The dedication prayers.

    "23.mp3": " Namibudam, namodama, namosanga, namodama, namosanga.  I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm sorry.  This last instruction which I gave to you about the six damas of Tilopa sounds like you're not supposed to think, but actually it is more like meant as a relief. more men like a remedy don't try  So hard. You don't have to reflect on the past. You don't have to anticipate the future. You don't have to comment the present. You know all this analyzing, all this extra work you are doing. No, no, no. Leave it as it is. And remember two friends of mine, really, Good friends of mine. One of them did the retreat together with me this year retreat.  and later on, did a second three-year retreat, which I was guiding and he's ten years older than me. So he's in the mid-70s now, 75, and he's a lama, he's teaching in Germany. The other one I remember now is a lama teaching in Brazil. And both of them, they have something in common. They could never calm their mind. It was just impossible. The mind was too active.  And sometimes when he reading these teachings, they would despair. They would think, oh, this is not for me. My mind is running all over. So this one close friend of mine, he was also diagnosed in the use as hyperactive syndrome. And he was a teacher. He became a teacher and then he of...  Of course, he did sports teacher. Yes, it is activity. And he loved dancing. And even today, as a lama, he is still going to his Brazilian friends and he's doing boxing. Yes, yes. And once or twice a week, he calls for boxing. And both of them, they love to dance. They love to, you know, active, active. And that is, I want to let you know, with all these instructions you should know.  There is a way, a Dharma way for the active people. You don't all have to go through shamata, coming your mind and then comes the inside. You can go differently, you can go through the inside and that will help you to calm the mind. That's a different way. My estimation is the way I know my students. I would say 80% are more first with Shammata.  then into insight and the other 20, if I teach them to calm the mind and not to do this and not to do that and so on, they freak out. Yes? And so there is a different teaching, a different approach for them and it is known. This is a known phenomenon. It has always been like this. It's not new. So we need to talk about the approach.  where insight comes first. And actually, I tell you honestly, with you these last days, I was following this approach. I was following the approach that I was giving you more insight teaching than giving you a chance to develop samadhyo. You might be waiting for your janas to occur, you know. They don't happen like this. We are going a different way. We are going the way of Inza.  Because that's the special thing about Mahamudra to use everything as the palm. And you don't first have to become calm, you just need to develop that capacity not to believe your cinema. That's what you need. The cinema can go on, the show can go on, the mind can be as active as it wants. You know, we are not lying when we say, allow all the appearances.  to arise and then suddenly we tell you, don't think. Now, no, there would be a contradiction there. This is not what was the meaning of the six Thomas of the Lumpur. It's just that don't get involved. Don't get involved with past, present, future means let it arise, but see through. See like you would be maybe some of you you love to see films. There could be a few of you who liked us.  films, yes cinema, at home, home cinema, TV, internet, whatever. You know, imagine that you were a professional in filmmaking. A professional in filmmaking who looks at the way the film is done. You are one of them. Yes, and you look at how the light is going, how the music blends with the scenes, how the actors are doing. There are so many things.  know how to really make a movie, so that the movie has an emotional effect. You want the emotional, a specific emotional effect at a certain time. Now, when we talk about Mahamudra with an active mind, we talk about this attitude of seeing through the film. To see through, oh, this effect produces that. When I have this coming in, then there is this fear. And that happens and I have this.  to see through the cinema. So it starts actually, actually it starts with the Buddha's teaching on the eight analogies of illusion. Ah, it's an old teaching, you know, we could go into it, but nowadays the Buddha would add to this list of illusions he would add movies. He was talking about rainbows, about mirage, for the Morgana that means.  He was talking about what else? Dreams. He was talking about, for example, the city of the Gandhavas, which is a city which never existed. Just fantasy. You know, Enzoan is giving examples like that. I'm not going into those examples now. That's not the idea. Because we have much better example. We have cinema. We have projection of films. and we can understand the  mechanism of projects. It was so easy. A good movie and we cry. We get tense. Even if it's just a football match, even if Germany loses or whatever, you know, you get into it. And if you know it's a movie or if you know it's just a game, then you can relax. So the idea is to see through the movie so that you I'm sorry.  able to relax and to look at it as if you were a professional filmmaker. So in the old Mahamudra teachings, there is, let's for example, the Lodzanslogen, which is be a child of illusion or behave like a magician. This means the explanation when you read the commentary is a magician.  Like in circus, when you have a magician in circus, you know, producing the rabbit from this leaf and so on, the magician knows his tricks. And he's the only one not fooled by the show. Okay, that's the idea. So you need to know your show. Otherwise, there will be suffering. If you believe the show of your own emotions, there will be suffering. That's good.  clear. Then you believe everything to be the way the very tense, the stressed mind is producing. That is the problem. If one doesn't see through the cinema of one's own karmic projection. So the imprints in our minds, the childhood experiences, and the one trauma on top of the other and all of that produces nightmare.  where it produces drama and it's not a comedy at all. It's difficult. Yes, and when you get caught in that, it is really suffering. So this approach, the one by seeing through the projections of your mind is the inside approach. This is directly going, and the what you need to do is you don't need to sit tens, you know, sit straight And so actually what you do is...  you relax as much as you can. You sit against the wall. You don't fall asleep usually because the mind is so active. So there's no risk. We do it in those times when there's no risk. If you add more tension to an active mind, it will become hyperactive. Definitely you need to relax. You need to...  Element Earth has to be encouraged. So, you eat good food, you relax and your mind produces all these thoughts. And then maybe you just have one line of this kind of instruction lying in front of you, maybe in big letters, you know?  For example, the sentence, be a child of illusion. Which is, or, know the show like a magician, or be like a scene, how do you say the filmmaker, what is the right word for that? A producer, yeah. Like, you give yourself an encouragement, and  And of course, in between we get caught. In between, okay, but this is part of the show. In between we get caught, but then we remember, maybe because our eyes fall on what we have in front of us. Ah, okay. It's pretty much a dream, all of that. It's like a dream. It's not exactly like a dream because it's not at night, it's during the day. And actually none of that is really going.  on now. All of these are thoughts about the past, about the future and some ideas in the present, but it's not happening here. Actually I'm fine. So this is how you, the producer, the filmmaker, whoever, a film critic, you know, would always know I'm sitting here in the hall and I'm watching a spectacle.  like on the screen and I see how well it is done. I can feed my reactions to it, but I can also see the audience. And I know, basically, it's just a fantastic production. OK, so this attitude you need to have. We need to look at your life as a fantastic production. And then, then comes the really interesting part. You can improve the production. you  Yes, you can make it better. What's this beautiful film with the... You know, this film with the same scene and it's an American film with the same scene as played again and again. Ah? Life of the Truman, is it dead? Truman Show. Truman Show?  Yes, yes, yes, yes, like this. So you improve your true man's show, your true woman's show. Yes, you improve that. And yes, and this is how in the show, you behave better. It's like, it's really like, see that you're acting in a drama. You are acting in a theatre play.  And every time you have a moment of awareness, it's a game, it's as if the curtain comes down. And after that moment of awareness, you have a new start. And that's the possibility. Because at that moment, you are out of it, you don't believe it completely. And then you can start again, a little bit differently. And I'm talking about small differences. And now it...  Instead of shouting loud with anger, you don't shout so loud. It was already better. And then you learn instead of shouting, you say, I could shout, but I'm not. Yes, yes. And the humor is coming into the game. And you don't take yourself and your projection so seriously. a little bit yes and still a lot but  less than before and you won't imagine what these small changes over time how much that changes your life. How much you will appreciate yourself with this little change. A little bit less drama, a little bit less anger, a little bit less desire, less often buying the show. You don't buy into the show so often. So you can be a little bit more relaxed.  And actually you begin enjoying life more. Yes, because you also feel you begin to feel your freedom to act. You begin to feel your freedom to actually influence your life. The mind is still active. The mind is still active all the time active. But in the activity, you are sailing a strong ship. wrong ship.  Now you are sailing in strong wind or strong ship and you learn how to sail with heavy winds. It's not so calm and you know like maybe for other people, you are going with great intensity in your life. And this great intensity, okay, you can't stop it but you learn to maneuver better with that. You are not just blown by the winds. You know, you're not just caught in your tummy.  cinema, but you actually can begin to steal. And this is where this steering capacity comes from seeing through the illusion. And you can go with an active mind until completely seeing through the illusion, and you never have to calm your mind down. You just become really capable in surfing. Yes.  really fantastic server in the world. But this is of course a long journey. Here we need to learn. The beginning is only stormy and we are being shaken about and we don't know what to do. And we desperately go to some meditation teaching because we think, oh, maybe if I learn to meditate, this will help. But then we sit there and everyone else becomes so quiet. And we are going nuts inside. the law scratching here.  They are wanting to move. If I only could go dancing, you know, with dream of activity. And then maybe you do meditation and dancing. Maybe you learn to play with that. Why not? Do your meditation with activity. And then after the physical activity, maybe that's the only good moment to sit down and experience a moment of quiet. That's my inti-bettent-tradition.  We have the prostrations. These, you know, 111,000 prostrations as a preliminary to Mahmoudra. I did them three times. Well, it's the whole preliminary. It was good for me to absorb my activity because I was very active. And then, with the activity, you know, you can let it out and then you're exhausted and then exhaust.  the body, it's easier to meditate. The mind is not so exhausted yet but the body and the body is then happy to sit still. When I entered three years with three, I didn't know it was going to be four years and so I was just, I built this block house in the forest in Dodonja, yes, and I had to clear the forest, make space and then I built the block house on pillars and so on. Then we entered retreat.  with Yadam and when I had all this wood, this tree is lying around. And I had been so active for building the house that it was difficult for me to sit still. It took me a while and so every time I was having little difficulty in meditation, I would go out and chop wood. I was chopping wood and everything by hand. The voice, the voice.  not using any motor, the S-O and so on. Everything was done by hand. Because it was the forest of yogis. And there were other yogis there. And so I was doing it as silent as I could. And my teacher who lived 80 meters away, then she gave me wonderful instructions. Yes, that's good that you job would. But how about if in between you sit for a while On top of your...  of wood. Just sit on top. After chopping instead of you know continue and continue make a little pause in between and sit. I was a wonderful instruction. With all my activity, I experienced moments of completely natural calm, not thinking about past, present, future, not analyzing, not meditating, just like that.  Because my energies have been liberated by enough work, and then like that you can learn. So I'm just giving this little message to you as a message of, hey, understand it properly. The idea is truly not to think about past, present and future, but if you have an active mind see through don't get involved with this cinema.  even if it is going on, there is a theme about past-present future. Yes, but you're not involved. Okay, like there is maybe a guy chanting something there, maybe it's only a recording. Yeah, we don't know if it's a live person. Maybe it's only a recording. Yes, it usually is, so  We could comment on the present. We could get involved. We could have emotions. We can also drop it. We cannot get involved. Depends is our decision, right? Maybe. Maybe tonight we don't get involved. Okay. That's it. It's like that. You decide for yourself when you get involved. The film is still going on.  The music still continues. And this is the same with all the ideas about life, all of what you think you are, what's happening, what your country is, and this and that, all the thoughts. Okay, open your eyes. How much of that is really happening now? Be them without.  And the cinema will continue again, but we then, without. Then if you want to think about something, think, think about it. Yes, think creatively, but just don't call it meditation. It is contemplation. You think about it and you want to think. So you do it. And then when you have another bit, you say, okay, that was a good thinking. Bye bye.  Relax again. And you do it, and if the cinema arises, it's not time to follow the cinema, you relax again. I'm practicing this video of, and I have a very active mind. Yes, I do have also periods of deep calm, but meeting so many people, hearing so many stories, Of course there is a lot, a lot, which wants to be...  digest it and that's fine, but I can let it arise without getting involved in it. Okay? So this was for all of us who have a predominant, the active mind. Maybe good news for you, if you have an active mind.  Yes. It applies to women and men the same. It's just the cinema is a little bit different. It's a lot of difference between the difference in the past. Yes, yes. I'm going to have to do it.  What is the mapping for? Well, there is already someone protesting and we should be so fair to let the women talk for themselves.  Yes. It's very happening in Kali. Look, look, I think this is up to the women to talk for themselves. Yes, this is only fair because as far as I know, it works for them as well. It's just different cinema, but it works. As far as I know, but you can correct me. Yes, so... Hmm  Well, since you mentioned man and woman, I give you a little bit tantric teaching on this. A little bit something maybe which helps. the view of Buddhist center the man.  are only on the surface man. If you go one layer deeper they are woman. And the women are only on the surface women if you go one layer deeper they are man. And if you go for both of them if you go another layer deeper they are neither woman nor man. Maybe you take that home there's a deep meaning in that. I had to discover the woman and me.  It was a beautiful discovery. And then I discovered that I'm neither man nor woman. But first the integration of my female side. And then letting go of course. And I have seen with women going the past that they were discovering the man in them. And then also letting go of course. When you look at awakened teachers, I mean those who have gone a lot...  way with practice. Of course they have their appearance, but the men show so many female aspects and the women, they show many male aspects. There is an integration of these forces happening. It's beautiful to see. So I just want to encourage every one of you to take that side of yourself also into the you  and don't be afraid to do that. You can only win. You win another half. I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say,  I say, I'm in. Hello, Valeriyam.  Okay, let's practice a little bit. You say more? I'm reminded of many years ago I went for the Dharma. I left.  everything and I arrived in India to practice and I had a long blonde hair back then and I had a very strong urge to go neither woman nor men to go beyond the identity so I shaved my head and it was in India and the children were walking after me calling me Gandhi and I was so insulted  How come they call me Gandhi? They really think I'm a man. But wait, I wanted to go beyond. And then when I reached to Thailand, I got so much praises for looking like a nun. And I was feeling so good. And then I said, wait, but I want to go beyond that. It was more on the superficial level. I realized cutting the hair and trying to go beyond in that way was not, it was maybe...  like halfway or maybe quarter of the way, but it was a good try. Something which works really well for people with an active mind is dynamic meditation. but you know that's something.  which this Rajneesh Bhagavan, what is he called, or show developed in those days. But it is so simple. Choose good music, choose good music, and play it, play it, and dance to it. And really dance to it until you feel the moment has come that you switch it off. And then you...  is it down? And it's so easy. It's so helpful. I don't like so many of the other things that this person invented or brought into the world, but yes, there are some good aspects. And if there are some, one should name them. This is among, it was, I tried that out because in those days in Germany there were so many followers of Him. and uh  So I tried that, yes, and it works. So at times, when you feel like it, why don't you try it out? Put the kind of music you like, dance. And then when you feel you've had your share, then sit somewhere. From our Tibetan teacher, we received pretty much the same instruction And we'll start.  prostrations. So you do these full-body prostrations stretching out on the floor, getting up again, do it and you know after 50 you are in sweat, after 100 you want to stop and then you continue. Yes and so we were doing lots of them. But the instruction was when you feel the moment has come then without drying yourself, without search  for your seed, just there where you prostrate, you sit down and you don't know anything, just that. And this is the Mahamudra idea about just being natural, let the mind be as it is, because in such moments you can experience it easily. You are not intonation plating. You are just after the exercise.  Stay. The hardest thing pumping, the lungs that are still working strongly and the mind just you look straight ahead and nothing to do. Don't try to meditate. Okay. But now we could try to meditate. Those who like...  to stand or to do a little walking or something you can do. I will not give, I don't think I will give many instructions now. So find your own best way of doing it. I will give the instructions now for the active mind. Please, those who was mind is calm. We stay was the  come mind and those and the others we do with I will try with the active mind. Okay. Okay. It's like Fireworks.  It's a lot going on. It's like watching fireworks. Lots of them. And it's very important to not fight with the fireworks, but to enjoy them, to leave them as they are, to give space.  All kinds of colors, all kinds of ideas. And you notice that this arises in space. If you have thought  But now I can't do it, I can't do it, you know, this is fireworks. Try and give space to that. If that are thoughts like you must, you should also just fireworks, cinema.  Yes, enjoy life. I'm sorry about that.  You can see how quickly everything arises. It arises, arises, arises. You can't even see the passing away. You only see the arising. Always something new. Thank you.  Sometimes you are surprised that there is a gap, if someone had forgotten to make fireworks. the tapence, sometimes a gap and then it continues.  And the times it is as if you were looking different films at the same time, just little images from there, another image from there to side. So if you were switching channels on TV, we like Spank. to look through the cinema through the TV on the other side.  Try to really look through. The space on the other side, the space on the one.  Now fighting with your own mind, this mind is active and it's beautiful. It produces so many beautiful images.  Sometimes we are caught. Maybe we like to be caught, then also we smile about that. when we don't like to record anymore we have the  option. Ah, okay. Yeah, this is one of my typical films.  you  And you enjoy a little ride in the cinema. It's not always good films that you're watching, that's clear. then even it's a little bit difficult to get out of a film you don't like.  so much. But then, yes, at a certain moment, as if you were shaking your head a little bit, you realize, oh, okay, that was the fair.  Sometimes with an active mind you feel like you want to run. You would like to run away. Find a place where you can hide from your own mind. This will not be possible. So stay and look and see that ink.  incredibly cinema, sometimes so loud, so powerful, but be aware that these are like magical productions. Incredibly realistic.  you  you  you  Allow the mind to be as wide as possible, as vast as possible. I like this guy.  you  you  Let's start making the first layer. That's not made-  make it too long. The mind is very active, then this kind of practice also needs to be short.  So to finish with this little instruction. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one.  The basic idea is to see, always to see, to see through. And not to become desperate about one's own mind. Mind can be very, very active. Mind can produce, wow, such powerful, such powerful scenarios. scenarios.  of desperate, so fearful, so everything. We say in the Buddhist tradition that we have all the six worms in us, which means that from hell to heaven we have everything. Everything is in our mind. We can experience all of that. and I'll  this is produced by the mind. And see it to be mind. This will be the most important instruction. This is what really will make a change. Like in cinema you see it to be a film, now in the real life you see it to be mind, you see it. You don't make more of it. It is the productions. and  they are ceaseless, they are without end. It's also important to know, you cannot stop the mind. You cannot stop it. Can relax it? But the more you relax, then you have a strange thing happening that because you relax a little bit more than even more arises. Oh, that was the intent.  in the beginning that there is more rising I wanted to have less. Yes, with a certain amount of control one can go for less, but this is for the people who have access to that. Yeah, this is for people who have access to a calm mind, but don't tell yourself if you are more of the active, the dynamic kind that you should have a calm mind. This is not what you should tell yourself.  You have an active mind, it's creative, go with that, save the energy of your own mind. Yes, we master that energy. So I give it again and again, a good direction, again and again, this identify with the show and then create your life with this active mind of mind in such a way that it is beneficial.  If you are normally of the active kind, you are normally the type of person who has a lot of ideas. There are a lot of projects and it is very spontaneous, many projects at the same time. Just take care to channel your energy so that you continue with the projects which are dear to your heart. You can finish them and don't engage so much.  in all the other ideas, which of course our mind also has. You don't have to buy into all these ideas. You are being challenged in the working meditation. Can you explain me a little bit more what is the challenge for you when you work?  It sounds to me like you're walking too slowly. You could walk a little bit quicker than you don't have these problems of balance. I think you'll always be lucky.  to walk and think. This is your habitual. So you think that it will be better when you slow down the working and then you have less thinking. But then the challenge is there that the working itself becomes a little bit strange. So if I allow, I will ask Lila, if I'm allowed to say a few words about Mahmoudra and walking meditation. Thank you.  I have been doing my Buddha meditation while joking. running, jogging and I would do like this when jogging.  You know, there's curved ways and then I can see, okay, 50 meters ahead, that is like a pole, I will pass that pole. So I will say myself, from now until that pole, I will remember to keep a spacious mind. So I jog, I jog and it's possible, yes, for that distance I manage to jog and not identify so much with the jogging but actually be in that space.  mind. Okay, then around the pole corner of the road street, you know, whatever. And then when I feel ready for it, I give myself again, I give myself a distance over there. Okay, until then I will run with meta in my heart, where I will be like imagining that light shines to all the little insects and birds and so on. Yes, and I will give myself like little tasks which I like.  while I move and Of course I can slow down and I am used for my all-time very slow walking also But I felt like you that slow walking sometimes is really artificial So in the Mahamudra tradition it is more Natural walking you walk as natural as possible and And you look where your mind is, so you can become interested in the body.  In the Mahamudra Tibetan tradition, you think sometimes that the lama the Guru is writing on your right shoulder, so that the Guru is working with you. So you take a walk with the Guru and this is the place of reverence. It's like you always circumvent the master, like this always on your right side. And then you walk while doing mantras, you walk while being attentive.  to the breathing, you walk while remembering the illusory nature of phenomena. As you walk through the kibbutz, you remember the illusory nature of phenomena. It's absolutely possible. Yes, you can give yourself little tasks where you walk. The walking releases the physical energy, but it is not in itself a means to get enlightened. It is only a support. So you don't have to slow down.  I appreciate, I saw some of you doing it really slowly, so I like that. Because for a certain kind of practice, for a certain kind of really getting absorbed and the movement and to feel, to develop a feeling for the body, it's good. But for other forms of practice, you would say, oh, there is too much fixation in that test, too much clinging to an outer form. I use the very slow working, I use it only when I feel my mind.  and really appreciate that. And I encourage you to find your speed. And whatever the movement is, you like to do. Doesn't have to be working. It's only written working meditation because we are in Tawana. So... Thank you, God.  Yes. So then I can actually apply it to any task. Yes. Any task. And for example, a good task is, okay, I will answer this email while writing the email. I put all my attention into writing this email and then I'm sure to make  little pause before answering the next one. So I program the pause already when I begin with the email it might take a while and some emails take 20 minutes or answers others are half a minute. So but I don't just go go go go I program the pause and I take the communication, the email it's self to be a dharma practice. So I have the dharma practice of responding to the male to  quality communication and the quality pause. And then I enter the next community case. Like this, it will be easier to do good work and to digest also a little bit to feel what this did with me before entering the next community case. It's like this, you know, I'm talking for everybody. So whatever your different works out program you know  direct your attention to the quality of what you're doing, do it really well, and then take care that very soon a pause is coming. This, like this, you can live very meaningful days because most of us we are lucky enough to have a kind of meaningful work. So what we are doing is actually we have chosen to do it. It's not so bad. it. If we do it well, it will be more satisfying than if we don't do it well. So we do it.  do it as good as we can, but we take care that it is not a non-stop activity. It has to have pauses again and again and again, many pauses. As a teacher, you have to give them a task and then you have a little moment when they talk. You inwardly you need to pause. The art of this communicative professions, like being a teacher, is that...  Why the other talks, you make your pause. You still listen, but you're not reactive yet. You don't think already about the answer. You're just listening, and you learn to be in a very receptive state. Of course, teaching young kids like you are doing is a little bit more difficult. As a therapist, it's very easy. Very easy. Yes. You switch to therapy, huh? Yes, yes. But you are doing therapy as a foreshadowing.  So you can also learn that there are little breaks. Find them. Yes. Yes.  It's the air, the wind, you're talking about the air, the wind, yes. Yes. I just put it up on the board just before it comes in here. You can see the link to the back page. I can tell you what it is called.  Let's go again, because this is the topic of tonight. We were with activity. We were with the active mind. And this is part of this, it fits very well to the teaching tonight, yes? We were with the dynamic creative mind. normally the the samsaric pattern which  is released there is a pattern of wanting to have more, wanting to improve the life. Which is based on dissatisfaction. I don't like what is happening. The basic pattern is envy, jealousy, ambition, competition, and so on, a world of dissatisfaction.  Now, this is, this dissatisfied energy makes people always try to improve their life. And this is where they build more and more houses, they use more and more resources, they never really happy. You know, the houses finished and they already think of changing the curtains and so on. You know, it's like never ending story. So what to do then?  the first step, I didn't explain that really, the first step is to develop satisfaction with how it is. So out in the outer world, to develop a sense of contentment, but here we are talking about the mind. that in the mind we find that as we open up, as we allow the mind to flow naturally.  We touch and a deep feeling of satisfaction, deep contentment. Yeah, and the third is connected with the fifth, right? They are on the opposite side. We are actually really, we are really seeing that all of this chasing for happiness outside is not bringing a solution. So a D  deeply relaxed mind then sees the perfection of the moment now. This is the fifth pedal, yes, this is the all accomplishing, this is the, and this seeing of the perfection of now is combined with an activity, the activity which normally wants to improve the world is available for all sentient  to show them that there is nowhere to go, that they already have the wishful feeling jewel in their mind, so to speak in their pocket is already at home. So the activity of this creative mind, we are under fifths pattern, under fifths energy, this is an all-perfecting activity, which means Shining.  Every mind stream that is own nature is perfect, it's not perfecting the world, it is showing how everything is already perfect.  Yes, yes, exactly. Yes, you share that. You share that. Exactly. And you become this catalyst. I was talking about on another day, becoming a catalyst. You are not inactive, but actually somehow you are radiating this.  Let's call it perfection. You are radiating this quality. This is what the mind does at that point. And you trust that activity of mind. So, I am, I have of course not talked about all the intermediate stages. There's a lot to learn in each of these areas. Basically, the teaching was about, hey, our mind is active, is creative. and when  without fixation, this activity is absolutely wonderful. It's a natural spontaneous presence for the benefit of our own, and it can manifest in all different forms. So we need that active mind. This is a sign which means good. Kim. Yeah. Yes.  Yes. So, as you may think, there are many providers, there are so many people who might be a lot in mind, or who are in the high-high level, everybody that is so sensitive, they're both arrived, and then it's hard to describe them.  That's it. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And see through the movie. Yes. Yes. Yes, always the movie doesn't mean to buy the movie but to see it through.  So yes, you can use both approaches. Sometimes it's really possible to do it exactly like that. Like when I was teaching it to you, then I was actually practicing that and it was possible. But at other times, like when I come back from meeting all of you and I sit in my room, when I sit in the morning on the lawn, then allow all the movies, all the impressions.  of the day to arise. I noticed them and they pass through. I don't get involved, but it's a kind of digestion. So I use the other form. I use to like seeing the movie and looking through the movie. It doesn't mean that one doesn't take it serious. It's all information about what is happening inside. But one is not adding onto it. One is not Giving more.  importance to it, so that it can really liberate itself. And yes, one can, even when you become fine, you can see, you can feel thoughts wanting to arise before they arise, and you can even stop before. You can relax that thirst for thinking, you can relax that wish that wants to think. And you don't even know whether that was going to be a thought about the past person of shoot.  You can just feel the movement towards the thought and you can already relax them. Which is wonderful of course if one can do it, but I'm not using it all the time because I have seen and maybe this is good to share with all of you. I have seen I was quite clever in this relaxing thinking and so on, but I felt that I was using it somehow to avoid emotions. So it was my  metrics of bypassing, spiritual bypassing, yeah, was like also using this. So part of my Mahamudra practice was then and still is to allow for the emotions to rise, not to relax them so quickly, only when they were properly tasted and seen, not expressed, need for that but not too quick. Don't try to get because this would be like an  to get rid of them. We don't want to get rid of them. They are fine. They are, as I said, their expressions of compassion may be unskillful, but nevertheless they express often a self-protection or a need. And yes, so learning to let them arise without getting involved is a big learning and life. It's a big learning.  because you see it's so easy to say, look through the cinema, but if I continue really proper teaching and then we are part of the cinema, the cinema needs us, it's like a theater, play, a drama act where we have a role. We are in a role in this world, we have many roles in this world. So the cinema we are talking about involves us and to  See that it is a play, means like an actor in the theatre, to get into the role, to be a school teacher, for example, to take on that role, but to not be identified with it. So school is over, I'm not a teacher anymore. Teaching here is over. I'm just a normal chap on the road, you know? I'm not continuing with the role when it's  not asked for. This is no identification. Yes, I'm a mother for my children, but not when they are adults, you know, when they don't ask me to be a mother. You know, this is a pain, you know, when the mother wants to be a mother and the child is already 50 years old, you know, it's like, you know, we have to adapt, we have to adapt. Sometimes it's nice and sometimes it's not asked for so...  We go into the world and the theatre play, we fulfil it properly, we play properly, like I try to be a proper teacher to you. But then, I am not dead when I go working, you know, and meet the next person. I am not a teacher, I am not dead. It's not asked for, it's not my role. I am just ordinary person. Just a normal guy. and then  David.  I'm even thinking that I have to ask someone instead of where I can push it. Are you did? Great. Tell us. Well, you definitely have some heavy news that I talked about in a thousand years ago, but that's just a bit of a bit of a negative news. It's a bit of a negative news, but it's a bit of a negative news.  It's called Daydream. It's not even that. Great, great. So yes, yes, yes. I have no way to enter. Very good, very good. Yes, this doesn't belong to the categorism  of past, present and future, it happens in the present, but it is sheer pure imagination. Yes. So, let's check. Were you aware? Yes. So, did you believe what was going on? Great. So it was meditation. He forgot. He forgot one.  He forgot one, we add the seventh one. That is exactly what that is. I am so happy that you shared that with us. I didn't know because this artificial situation of allowing for the active mind. I didn't know if someone here would be able to really feel the active mind. and you did. You failed it and you...  unleashed it and it's great that you're talking about it and you didn't buy the story and that's the meditation. Exactly. That's seeing through. So then you can watch lots of movies. And then you will feel there's of course this now you were enjoying, you were this nice, but this is extreme.  when you... then two experiences can happen. One is that there is all of that going on and you feel very peaceful at the same time. You're nodding, is that what you felt? You felt peaceful while it was going on. So this is the first experience. The other experience might also have had someone here in the room. Normally you are...  have an active mind and when you allow your mind to be active, nothing is happening. Ah, some people are nodding. Okay, so this is also an experience that as soon as you are not on the breaks, anyway you say, go, think! Nothing happens. And that's also a very good experience. Because the permission...  takes away the pressure. And this is a very important understanding that sometimes it is just the pressure that we feel under which we put ourself, which creates all that incredible activity. And for you it was different, it was the... Actually you can see a lot of joy in what you are sharing, a joy in the creativity of mind. And that's fine, so really, at times  and draw like that. It's fantastic. And there is a certain time to respect. There's a staff meeting still waiting, or something like this, yes? Yeah. Let me sing the Tibetan dedication. Are you want to sing the mantra? How you want to sing the mantra?

    "35.mp3": " Namodama namosanga. What we do with these three little salutations is that we actually...  Actually we say hello, we salute our most beloved ones. Good morning or are you awake at once? Good morning beloved Dharma, beloved life. Good morning all living beings who can be my guides. And...  If we do it with this attitude then already we are there, already we are into it. And this morning when I was sitting on the bench in the park as you were then I had the feeling today I share with you the mod, the longer prayers, the longer singing that I usually do  When I start my practice is also not very long, it's the same meaning. I first greet the lineage, the lineage gurus, in a very essential form, visualizing them as one luminous Buddha figure, called Vajradada. Then I go for the future and detect the body's sound valve.  and then come the four immeasurable, just simple wishes.

But indeed it is possible.  I astonished amazed that the Dharma has come to me, that I have been able to be here. you  amazed and thankful for all the conditions, the many many conditions that needed to come together for this to happen.

How easy is that even if my feelings feel so strong?  Just a little moment directing our attention to freedom. And then if that is possible.  can breathe in that and the breathing in this wondrous freedom which is there for a little gap, a little pause. The breathing can make it continue a little bit. We allow this freedom to be dynamic but holding on  on simply thoroughly enjoying it. So let's breathe for a while, reminding ourselves from time to time, to open up to this amazing beauty of this mind.  Thank you.  I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide.

And when you're direct, you're attention to this experiencing mind, this ongoing living experience.  Have a look just how much space there is, the spacious quality that allows for everything to arise, how fluid that experience is. But not only in one direction.  moving dynamic unhindered in all directions, in all fields of awareness. you can feel that for the relaxed mind which is not grasping.  Then whatever appears in our personal cinema has the same taste. The taste to be very much there as an experience. It is ungraspable as images on the screen.  And again, there is the sense of wonder of amazement. Just how many thoughts those experiences are? How fine, how diverse? freshness and fun.  of experience. And that is a sense also that all of this is quite perfect, that there is nothing, nothing needs to change.  It's a perfect moment, a perfect experience of being just like that. Whatever arises, continues into the next experience, or it dissolves into simplicity, Trust me.  I've been talking to you a little bit about the self-liberating quality of all experiences. The next step would be not to watch the self-liberation of appearances, but to be the Sir Flavarez.  to enter that awareness to be this flowing experience, to be this self-liberation of far.

    "21.mp3": " It is half time. It's just an invitation to relax, to change your post, so come out of a little meditate, probably if ever there was any. Exactly, give your face a little massage, if you like. all the things which I quit.  Notice how in the pause, Meditate.  to the awareness kind of continues, why you are in the pause. Do you know what I mean? This is subtle awareness of yourself, how you feel, or the mind is, continuing, thanks to the previous practice.  Now how would you continue if the pause never stopped? It just continues. We continue in the pause. We never start to meditate again.  I will give you a little instruction, a key instruction of Mahamudra. The so-called Six Dhammas of Tilo Par. Don't reflect about the past.  Do not anticipate the future. Do not think about the present. Do not analyze. Do not meditate. Leave the mind natural.  Okay, see some of you are trying to write that I will repeat it. Of course it will come again in the teaching. Yes? Okay, we go again. Do not reflect about the past. and disobey the future.  Do not think about the present. Do not analyze. Do not meditate. And then the exasperated students shout, But what shall we do? Leave them.  natural. How it will do that? Well, these instructions give us a little hint about how to do that. It's all about not doing many of the things we like to do. Terrible instructions, 5 times no.  And then one time yes. Okay, I will guide you a little bit through. Ready for a little wake up meditation. Put yourself in a comfortable pose, which allows you to be present. And you can continue standing, it's really fine. Sitting.  Yes, one person has been lying down. This is a good choice also. We have so much space now. So you can use that. Be kind to yourself. Just the one snoring has to offer ice cream to everybody. So take care. Be there even if you relax. Yes.  And if you feel that your neighbor is falling asleep, just touch him a little bit. Thank you for showing the example. Now with this group.  If you just a short instruction, more will come in the teaching. So no notebooks are needed. The ground of meditation is always the breathing, like the waves of the ocean. rolling waves of the ocean.  It's always there, the pulsating of life. And when we follow the life's pulsations, when we are really in it, when we become life that is no need to reflect about the past.  Just see how useless it is now that we meditate. I'm not talking about normal life. Now that we meditate, that is useless. The past is gone. It's not an object of exploration. So we relax all those thoughts connected to the past.  Even the past moment of experience. We also do not anticipate the future. Don't even think about what a teacher needs to say next, or what needs to.  to be your next understanding. No need. Just be... The future is nonexistent. It is only a speculation of mind.  Not reflecting about the past experiences, not anticipating future ones, be in the now. And please do not think about the now, the present. live it, be it.  And do not analyze whether you are doing it well. Do not analyze whether the now is empty or not.  Just leave it as it is. You experience this life, this smile. please  Do not hold on to this precious experience of now. Please, do not meditate. Do not cultivate anything. It's already there that what you are looking for. Leave the mind naturally as it is.  you  you  I again  Do not hold on to it. Nothing's better.  you  you  Yes, I see some of you really releasing this attempt to keep the now and the cage Leave the now free. Let the now evolve.  Good space to your own very personally experienced now. It is inside, not outside. Continue to see when you turn your head. Continue to ask you, breathe.  No need to hold the breath.  And if you have a little more awareness, you notice that nature being is also there when you become drowsy. you  not lose it. It's always there.  you  you  you  I ask you to consciously make this tiny movement some part of your body just to make sure that you are not locking the experience of now into some body posture. It's always there on thatcher being.  This is also there when the thought arises, a feeling.  you  you  I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing.

And you should do it with the feeling of really, wow, this is great. You have done great, and this experience of relaxation.  is really great. You said you can stretch out your legs. I'm not sensitive to that, like Asian teachers might be, can stretch your leg in any direction you want.  And taste these initial moments of giving up, giving up practice based on effort. you  Very good taste of what it means to experience a pause.

    "20.mp3": " Namodama namodama namosanka namodama namodama namosanka namodama namosanka. It is in this spirit that we gather in this spirit of\u2026  confidence in what is traditionally called the three Jules, but actually it's just one Jule. Kod Buddha Dharma Sangha but just one. Buddha is the awakened one, because Buddha means awakening and and Dharma is what awakening For nouns, it offers as a gift of compassion to all sentient beings and the sentient beings.  things are the Sangha, it's the friendship which connects us and then the know-veh Sangha are those who have understood the Dharma and have an experience of awakening. So they are an expression of awakening. Here, Sangha is simply a prolongation of the Dharma. The Dharma is a prolongation of body, of awakening, of that. And we gather in this spirit and maybe Maybe you don't know what now?  or means I forgot to tell you, number means I pay homage or I pay respect or it can also mean I prostrate, it means all these three things. And it is the shortest refuge formula that exists in the world. So when I come to a new place and I don't know whether people are familiar with refuge, then I use this one very shy, you know, maybe it works for you to inwardly or outwardly.  follow when we say namodama, namodama, namodama, and since I know that many of you have have a strong religious background from your families, from your upbringing, then I just want to remind you that you don't have to leave another religion or tradition in order to practice to Buddha's past. You simply give it a deeper meaning. You give it a  meaning of a path going towards liberation and awakening. And you take whatever you can from that learning, from that upbringing, you take it with you as a very helpful tool on your path to liberation. You don't know much about me, but I can tell you, you know, I'm the son of a Protestant pastor, right? So, and this protestant family, my mother was...  also religious instruction teacher, had three uncles who were Lutheran priests. And one brother, one of my three brothers is a Protestant priest and has made it a Protestant priest. My God, I'm surrounded by them. And I'm sending them on WhatsApp, I'm sending them little messages. Did you recognize this? And it was not my priest brother who answered, but my manager brother the headset. This...  This is the mount of transfiguration, you know, Mount Tabo right here, next to it. And today I sent them like the videos, you know, where Jesus is supposed to have taken a little promenade on the walk, on the water. So I let them guess, because there have been many times here, my parents have been a dozen times here in Israel and they love the country. from now to the first time.  And my brothers have always accompanied them on the various trips and so they are also very familiar. So just to let you know, refuge is not something sectarian. Refuge is something that opens. It opens us up to new possibilities. New possibilities that we didn't know about that there existed. Because somehow our perspective of the spiritual path was maybe a little bit more narrow.  and not so clear. And the Buddhist path goes well along with a path of blessing, of inspiration, you know, like devotion to the Divine. Yes, but you have to know what is this Divine. You know, you have to know what it is. And actually, basically it's the nature of our mind. And it is that where we find that open dimension that creative.  dimension from where all the words arise. You know the creativity of our mind. I've been talking a little bit about that. And now what is so beautiful about this Buddhist path is that it has a great deal of wisdom. And this wisdom comes from experience. Actually, the Buddhists, they are very much And you can say a family of research.  They are researchers, they are explorers, explorers of how to find freedom, how to find liberation in different circumstances. So wherever the Buddha's teaching went, they explored how in that country, at that time, under those circumstances, how is it possible to go a path of liberation? How is it possible to be free when all around? side is.  business as usual. You know, it's like always creating trouble. So, actually, the Dharma usually went to places because there was trouble. Because, if the people had been happy, the Dharma wouldn't have been asked for, and it was only on request that the Dharma came. It was never, you know, like a missionary action or something. Maybe you don't know, but It's important to know.  A Buddhist monk is not allowed to speak about the Dharma without being invited. We never teach the Dharma without invitation. So the Dharma were not spread by standing up on the marketplace and making a little propaganda speech. Not only on personal invitation, so you can be sure that when the Dharma spreads through the world, It was on invitation everywhere.  everywhere. People were suffering, were in stress. They wanted something to help them with that stress. And this is what we call then the past liberation. It is then it has been called Buddhist past. It has been called Buddhism. But actually it's much better to just call it Dharma. Dharma means the path to liberation or the teaching which liberates or the realization that liberates.  And with the tradition we make the difference between the Dharma of words and the Dharma of realization. And you remember, the words are just the finger pointers, the pointers to the moon. The realization is the moon. So the dharma of words, these are all the pointers, the words of the teaching. And to what they point to, that's the moon.  what you have to see for yourself. Yeah, you have to look, you have to see, you have to become seeing. So, when the moment when we become seeing, this is then some of our quest of our explorer, explorer Johnny has already then given some fruition. And this is these moments of seeing at the moments when we begin to...  eat the fruits of our gardening. Yes, dharma practice is very much a gardening practice also, taking good care of the garden of our mind. And this is a nice bridge over also into what we call compassion in the Buddhist way. Compassion in the Buddhist tradition is like gardening. and  In the fields we are gardening, they are called Buddha fields. And every sentient being's mind is called a Buddha field. So you have a Buddha field and you take care, you are the gardener and you come to an experience gardener and you ask, how can I take care of my Buddha field? And the experience gardener will say, oh look, this is how I have done. And actually here we have some.  We have some seeds, we have some karmic seeds, we have some wholesome, some unwholesome seeds, and you know this is how you take care and this is how you purify, you know you take care of the ripening of the not so harmonious. Yeah, seedlings and here this is what you wish to grow and actually the secret of the gardener is it all grows by itself. So you just have to create  the atmosphere in which the qualities, the innate qualities of your Earth, they can sprout. It's already there, all the qualities are there. So a good Gardener is one who just takes care that the Poisonous stuff, let's call it like that, like the mind Poisons, that the Poisonous stuff is not receiving more attention. will not water them okay and  They do what all plants do when they are not watered, they wither. They shrink. They can't grow further. So we don't have to take care. They just do it by themselves. They so-called unholy some states of mind, if they are not encouraged, they are not given more water, more attention. then they did Wendell, they did Wendell, they disolved, you know what?  actually much quicker than in the garden, much quicker. Yes, it's like wonderful to see how quickly that is. In the others, they receive more attention. And you remember this morning's practice, I'm going to talk a little bit about what we practiced this morning. You can enter into this meditation this morning, the unity of wisdom and compassion. This is what we were practicing. Right.  And we will continue like this for this second part of our retreat. Whatever we usually do, I will do a practice with you, so that you have a personal experience, and then in the teaching I will explain what we have been practicing. It's a nice way to go about. But always first I try to kind of create that atmosphere in which you can make a person experience.  experience and then with the teaching I explain a little bit more so that you can do it at home. So this gardening that I was talking about is that capacity about which I talked at the end of the guided meditation, this capacity to direct your attention, to direct your interest towards what what this hole is.  And this is like watering. This is watering those areas of your being, you give them the attention. And the others, we don't have to fight with, no need for fighting. We just don't water them. Okay? We just don't give them attention. When I see, wooo, anger, hatred is coming up. Fear is coming up. Okay, I see you.  part of this mind stream, it's very fine. I see you, I accept you and you are allowed to go the way everything goes. You are allowed to to dissolve my attention flows on to something which is more beneficial. And at the end of that warning meditation I told you where, it is very beneficial.  to return to simplicity and we simply return to breathing and then of course this breathing then becomes also a very symbolic breathing which has all the qualities of man's nature which we have been developing in the last days. I have developed the explanation, I mean, they were already there, these qualities. So these qualities that we are talking about,  Are these famous five qualities which make up the Lotus? Yeah, the Lotus that we were talking about, Central Quality is the Spacelessness. And we give water to our, we are interested in discovering just how much space is there. Right? This is the act of compassion. It's an act of compassion to go towards wisdom. We do it because we...  We love ourselves and we love everybody else. So because we want to be free, we become interested in where we can find freedom. And one of the most important ingredients of freedom is space. To be able to breathe. To be able to have mental formations, movements and mind. And they have the space to be. control.  Not fighting, just letting the natural creativity of mind express itself in a very loving atmosphere. So we must say that liberty, liberation freedom, awakening has to do a lot also with a loving environment. So it's a spacious awareness already coming from compassion. This base...  that we find is actually also a space that we offer to ourselves. We allow ourselves to go there in spite of our difficulties. Together with the difficulty, actually later on, or even, of course, you can't wait, but we will invite the difficulty into the space. We will take it with us. You don't like that? No, you want to leave it here.  It won't work. If you leave it behind, it will knock on the door. And exactly in those moments when you like it least. So best is to invite the difficulty in those moments when you are stable. So you can make it wait a little bit. I can say, not now. Let me prepare first. Let me prepare first by contemplating the basic nature of mind. This...  the spacious nature, the fluidity, the equal taste of all phenomena, you know, this equality, then linking into that vivid, luminous experience of life with that creative dynamic. And then in that, you know, being really rooted in that and breathing with those qualities, Then you can maybe open the door and say before  for your knock, okay, come in for a short moment. Not too long, and then you let it, and then you direct your attention again to something else. But in a small dosage, very small, just so that it is not overwhelming, you allow that, which is difficult to come to mind, and then you have to have that capacity to direct your mind again to what is the refuge, You can say what is the nature of my-  what ought to breathing, you have to be able to let go. So this capacity to invite in, what is difficult, and then early enough to direct your mind again to the qualities. This is what we need to learn in meditation. All other meditation, if we want to keep all the difficult stuff outside, that is like saying, some Sada has to stay out. Yeah, it's it's  too much, it's overwhelming. If you're not on your knock a little bit on the door, at some point it will take over our meditation and then we don't know how to deal with it. We are only in those thoughts and those problem thoughts. And so we better do it in small doses. We prepare the ground and we take it again and again. And actually it's not much of a personal decision. the mind will do it by...  itself it will bring in something painful and then you know okay here it is welcome and already with the next out breath you can move on you have seen it you're not suppressing it because the in-breath is opening into that space with the out-breath you leave it go and you're back into that pause. Oh we have prepared the  ground or you have become familiar with the pauses. At the end of the out breath, it's so easy to make a pause. The embrace comes by itself. You stay in that pause, often not clinging. And then the embrace comes and maybe a new sensation arises, new Vedha Naha, new sensation survives in whatever field of experience. Okay.  And if you have that capacity to always let go of what was arising before, then we call this the fluidity of mind. This is the second quality, remember, and the Lotus. This is the fluidity which allows for the unhindered arising and seizing of appearances, like in a mirror. So we have the spacious quality of mind.  And the fluid unhindered quality of mind. And we have this ungraspable nature. I call it like that. I prefer this term ungraspable to the word empty. Empty sounds so empty. It's not empty. It's full. But it is not graspable. It is empty of a substance. It is not empty. It's full. as the planet should reside.  friends, I think the word even exists in English. Yeah, the plenitude, the full, the richness of experience, but hey, if we have a look, then this rich experience, it's of course, it's changing all the time, and because it's changing, the moment I try to grasp it is already something else. It has already evolved and it is new, it is fresh and...  It's continuing to evolve. So that changing nature of our experience of life, this is the same as saying it is ungraspable because the moment we would like to hold on to it, it has already changed, it's a little bit different. And so the mind, which is receptive to this ungraspable nature, is can see that so well because  Because of that inherent fluidity, so as we go in that space with the fluid movement of experience, then it becomes easy to see the anglospital nature. They go together. Actually, they are all expressions of the same, because it's spacious, it's unhindered and fluid, and because of that it's anglospital. Yes? And then we go to the next one, the next pattern of the lotus. That is...  the luminosity, the luminous nature of mind. Because it's so spacious and fluid and ungraspable, then it becomes so vivid. It becomes so alive, because no clinging, no grasping, obstructs that vivid experience of life. So it's like crisp, you know, like, you know, like for the first time feeling your own breathing, And  It's like so unique, yeah? This is because there's no comparison, no clinging to what was before, what needs to be afterwards. We are so much so in the moment with this clarity and luminosity of mind, that we feel very much alive. We feel more alive because we see the ungrasp of a nature. It is, it is so wonderful because if we are grasping, you know, to ten.  And we are still hanging on to the last moment of experience. We are hanging on to something that was before. That's the nature of grasping. We are hanging on. We are not free for the new. So to stop ourselves from this grasping movement is actually seeing the ungrasp of the nature. We don't have to tell ourselves, don't grasp. No, no, it won't work. Now it's like a child.  Don't take the chocolate, no, no, it doesn't work. You know, it's not like that. You have to see that the chocolate is already melting. Well, it's like, you see that that what you want to hold onto is a conditioned experience. It arises because of various conditions. And the only thing we can do, and this will be the last petal that is missing, is true.  create the conditions of those experiences that we want to nurture, that we want to cultivate, experiences of awakening, of love, of friendship, of whatever. So this is the compassionate creative side. The last one is the creative one, that which is the active side of compassion. And this.  morning I made it a little bit, I started with making it a little bit clear to you that we have this receptive side of compassion. We are so much resonance, but we are not only resonance. Each one of us here in the room, although now, because I'm the one talking, you're much more on the receptive side, but while you're even now only receptive,  You are shaping the reality of what happens in this room. You are shaping your own reality right now. You have taken your place, even some of you have shifted places, since we have started the second part of the week, of the retreat. You are shaping the space where you are, no one else can sit. You are actively shaping the situation. in response to what you feel.  You felt, oh, I would like to sit up more front, I would like to sit next to a wall, I would like to be a little bit out of the immediate contact, you know, you would feel your needs, you feel the possibilities of the situation and you act. And this is the active side, it's the karma side, yeah, it's where we create something. And this is the necessary second part of compess.  And we have talked about this already on the weekend. I think it was one of your questions that made me talk about it. It is this question about feeling so much pain, feeling so much fear, feeling so much stress, and then we talked about feeling quite stuck with all of our sensitivity.  that we are so receptive and sensitive. And in order to protect ourselves, we need to close. We feel we only have that possibility to close. Now, the answer to that, the general answer is, we have to find a way for the active side of compassion to manifest itself. So that is where I said where even singing  a mantra or even making a little wish, may also you be happy, or even if I can't open my heart to you now, maybe meet in another situation where it is possible, you know, to make these little wishes, to make some movement with the heart on the active side. Yes? I know people, when they watch TV,  Is that detonation? So what is this? Maybe. What is this? Welcome in Israel, you want to say? Yes, yes, I'm here. I'm with you. Yes, yes. We continue the teaching. We continue the teaching underground. Okay? That's no problem. Yes. So, let this just trigger  of an association which I like to share with you. When the war in the Ukraine started, I really made many meditations of sitting with them in the subway. Yes? And you know, like really going there and trying to feel how it would be possible to meditate there, not meditating in a closed way, but meditating maybe with hands joined or with, you know, really aware of it. Have you heard?  needs a lot of preparation. So I was saying that we need this active expression of compassion. And if you are in the situation of fear, you should know that the fear itself is already compassion. You don't need to look for the compassion elsewhere. Fear is a mechanism to...  protect ourselves. And it's a movement of compassion. It's not so skillful because it narrows our capacities, because we might get stuck in the fear, but fear is something that signals us, hey, take care, okay? So fear is already compassion. Only we might use that energy in  more skillful way. We are lacking wisdom there. A fear that makes us get stuck is not so helpful. I give you an odd Tibetan example. You know that Tibet has so many, how do you call them, ravines, ravines, you know, these steep cracks, these valleys, these valleys. Yeah, well, it's...  but it's more than a valley. It's like really going down and you see the river down there, you know. And canyons. Can we let's use the word canyons? Yes. And then you have these bridges going over, which are made of wooden panels, connected with ropes. And they're swinging awfully. Yes, and you have to, and for many people it's very much fear. It's fear to go over.  Now, if you want to walk over such a bridge, I've recently crossed one of those bridges in Switzerland. I got the feeling of the swinging and so I had my mountain bike with me, my partner also a mountain bike and we went over this. Yes. And then if the fear makes you rigid, you have less chances to get across the bridge safely. So what is needed is to...  A heed to be watchful, to be careful, to be mindful. That is really needed. And that's an expression of wisdom plus compassion. You see the fear which blocks us often makes us uncapable of acting. It makes us uncapable of feeling the next situation. Nettles our looks so much that we lose our  panoramic vision. But we can feel the need for protection, we can feel the need for a heightened mindfulness, we can feel that and we can follow it and we can be very careful like walking through bushes when you think that could be snakes, you know, you have to be very careful, maybe you use a stick to tap on the floor, you open, you know, you go very you  careful, but to be afraid is not so helpful. Careful is very helpful. Yes? So this care, this care is the good side of the need for protection. This is the compassionate care, which when exaggerated becomes a fear. So if you care for your beloved ones, that's very good. if you're  You have a 12 year old daughter, you don't want her to be out at night and coming home. Nobody knows when she's only 12 years old. Yes, maybe you want her to be home at 10 o'clock or something or 12 or whatever your agreement is. You care for her. But if you are fearful all the time, it won't help. It won't help the situation. makes the mother angry against the daughter and it makes stress.  and so on. So this is where the wisdom comes in. Wisdom has such a great effect of relaxing us because wisdom and the Buddhist tradition means awareness. Our Vitya, lack of awareness is translated as ignorance. Actually it means that we don't see, we don't see clearly. We think we believe fear helps.  or we believe anger helps, or we believe desire helps us to make us happy. We believe behind every emotion is a belief that this emotion is the best way to handle the situation. And this is a lack of awareness. We don't see really what is going on and what is really needed. So wisdom is actually then.  an expression of which helps us to be even more compassionate. The wisdom helps us to relax, so to develop wisdom is yet another form of compassion. The more we understand the situation, the more compassionate we can be in that. The more compassionate we are with ourselves and others, the more we want to understand. So.  The wisdom we talk about in the Buddhist tradition is actually the result of compassion. The whole story with this Buddhist path of liberation and awakening started with the compassionate wish to find an end to suffering. That's the whole story. The whole motivation to understand, to develop a deeper understanding of life.  It's because of wanting to find true happiness, which is the most loving and compassionate wish you can have. So if you can see that, how wisdom arises due to love and compassion, then how that wisdom then helps to have much more compassionate means that you're disposed of much, you know, then you can only talk about compassionate wisdom and wise compassion. Now they become one.  and on the subtle level of experience, then the lucidity of mind, which is also this receptive side, this interbeing as I said, or as a stichna turn said, this interwoven experience of ourselves, woven into all the world around us.  This is what allows us to understand. It is thanks to being connected that we understand. It is thanks to feeling ourselves and others that we understand ourselves and others. It is thanks to opening up to the world and being able to feel it that we can understand it. And then as  as there is a natural expression of that wisdom. Actually, this movement towards the world to bring our understanding into the world is compassion. Simple example. Let's take a father this time, not a mother. A father, oh my god, yesterday was such a nice situation. I saw a father going with his daughter into...  the water in lectic areas. And he was taking care of her. She was very small, and he was taking care. And every movement where she was in danger to maybe go underwater, he held her. And these movements, these are so spontaneous, they're inbuilt in us. We definitely want to immediately  protect someone else from suffering. And it is the wisdom that sees, this might be dangerous. It is the wisdom, who knows, which knows that head underwater is not so good. Yeah, this is wise. It is life experience. So it is the wisdom, which is the knowing aspect, aspect and which is very receptive.  which then automatically leads to the action of helping someone not to fall, not to drown, learning to swim and so on. They always go together. There is no compassionate action without wisdom. If the wisdom is lacking, it's maybe not so wise, then it's maybe just not helping the other person. It's like a person is already drunk and asks you for another bottle of rum.  and you offer that bottle of rum that's not really compassion, you know, might kill the person. So this is the kind of lacking wisdom. It's sounds or feats may be compassionate but it's not true compassion. The compassion we talk about is always wise and the wisdom we talk about is always compassionate. We cannot separate the two. So this is what we were meditating today  and we were meditating it on a subtle level, breathing in, breathing out, tuning in to those qualities of the mind. And this is something I would offer you to take home that you actually, by little, remind us that you yourself.  This capacity to remind yourself of the essential that you use that capacity to remind you of discovering the openness of the experience, discover the fluidity, discover the angra-spiriminature, the equality, Discover the uniqueness, this luminous  of, wow, freshness or experience now, and discover how mind is shaping this experience at every moment, the active, creative side. Because sati is the creativity. Okay, you have to understand that this Mindfulness, this is an activity of the mind. This is the compassionate activity of...  mind directing us back to what is most wholesome again and again and again. Sati is an expression of compassion. You are familiar with the word Sati. This is what is translated as mindfulness. usually we translate it more properly as reminding ourselves of the  which is most wholesome. And what is most wholesome? You decide. Sati always goes where your interest goes. So if your interest wants to simply follow the breath, Sati reminds you of breathing. If your interest goes to trying to find where is that compassionate quality and my being, my being then sati guides you towards finding the  compassionate aspect of interbeing. Sati reminds you to always go back to that. If you wish with your Sati to explore impermanence, change and the angriest of the nature, then Sati will guide you there. Each time Sati, this mindfulness, is the expression of an interest and this interest as the expression of your compassion. A wise compassion.  that knows which plants in the garden you want to water now. And when we start meditation, any session of meditation, we are a little bit like a gardener, going into the garden, feeling the garden, having a look around, and looks what needs to be done. Yeah, where do I need to water now? Or maybe do?  I have to do a little bit of clipping here and there, you know. And like this then, we direct our meditation in such a way that it really fits the needs of the moment. The meditation is not always the same. Actually, I've never had a same meditation. And I tell you, having taught so many people, you give the same instructions to I'm sorry.  15 people to 100 people, they will all follow the instructions but you will have 15 or 100 different meditations because everyone is anyhow adapting the instructions to his own mindset. You can call this ignorance but you might also call that compassion. Now, what, which part of this?  Adaptation is wise compassion, in which part of that is following the old habits. This wise compassion will find out. Your own wise compassion will find out just how much you need to adapt the instructions to yourself, because otherwise there will be a friction between what you try to meditate and how you fear. if you feel tired  and this guy in front talks to you about luminous mind, you might feel, this is not quite what I need to practice right now. I might follow a little bit this luminosity, but I will do this, relaxing back, maybe lying down. I might try not to fall asleep, but I will connect to luminosity. More like this from the inside of sleep or something. You know, you will find your own ways of adapting that.  And the other person and the room was said, yes, luminosity. Straightening up, looking straight, with open eyes into the mind. And we think that this is luminosity. Maybe. It's a little bit fabricated luminosity. Okay. So we find out that this is the habitual tendency of wanting, which fabricates something. and the rear X-plot  tries not to manipulate the situation. So we explore and we find that luminosity which is there before we even have started exploring. Okay, that's the idea. We find the openness which is there before we start turning our attention to it. We try to find the fluidity which is there before we create fluid. be created.  No, this is not the way to create it. It's there. It's there. Don't talk so loudly about it because it's shy. Yes, it's like this. Exploring mind is like going very softly into your mind. because if you might have noticed how difficult it is to breathe in and to breathe out without changing your breath.  to have the attention with the breathing. In the beginning you have the feeling it always changes to breathing. And then you find out awareness can be in the breathing without changing it. And this is a greatest recovery. Awareness can be in the minding process. This is the mind. The mind doesn't exist. It's a minding process. It's a process.  of experiencing, awareness and experiencing can become one without changing the experience. And this is wonderful. Then you are really exploring. This is like the top ideal of every scientist to explore the situation with the minimum of change introduced into the situation, and not because every scientific expert  the experiment has the problem that the experiment itself orders the situation. So, same in meditation, the way we explore is so softly, so light-handed that there's only a minimum influence. And this is again, wise compassion, which does that. Why is compassion is not too many?  manipulate the mind. And this is Mahamudra. Mahamudra is the part of working with the mind without manipulation. It is the unity of compassion and wisdom, understanding that they don't need to be created. There's no need to produce wisdom, no need to produce compassion. just find it and we were try to find it.  We will, in the practice session, I will hopefully be guiding you a little bit in this explanation. Okay. The last minutes, let's spend in silence.  We are already breathing.  And how about imagining to cross such a bridge? You know, such a bridge across the canyon. Breathe your way through. Work that bridge of mindfulness. Just be the experience. Space.  Flushes, fluid, always on the move without clinging. Very present, finely differentiating, knowing each step, each breath, and active. Moving forward.  and responding to the changing situation. And I'm sure you will all make it because from this pitch you cannot far.  you  I have the in-brab. you  And there will be our plan. This is step on the bridge. Now has it has been...

We actually take them into our meditation. They sound very philosophical, but somehow lots of our beliefs are constructed around them. Oh, yeah.  The way we deal with those questions, if you have such questions from time to time, the way to deal with them is to ask them and then not to give an answer.  Only fear. No answers allowed. Only directly tuning in into that space, which is opened by the Chris. The answers will come from conditioning, from belief systems. We are not out for that. We are not into discussing.  If you want to know if a self exists or not, if a mind is there or not, look for it. But don't come quickly with questions or with answers.  I'm going to go to the next slide.

But he didn't say there is a self, or did he say there is a God? And I mean I always talk about the Buddha, but this is, I can talk about recent masters See you.  I gave you some answers in the last days, but to become free it is not convenient to believe the answers. You'll have to make sure for your  the same.  I'm going to go to the next slide.

It was a dreadful time for me when my master was asking me as all these questions, many more than these. We had to answer them all from direct experience. And you wouldn't let us pass with just intellectual answers. No way.  A little bit like the quants and the Zen tradition and the Rinzai Zen. One thing which I have learned from that which is very helpful is to sit with an attitude Off night.  knowing and to find your peace with not knowing. That's already a very good start. A very good opening for discovery.  I'm sorry.  Let us breathe in and out, and that fluidity of not knowing, not being so sure. This is not the same as not caring. We care. But we don't.  We are very interested. And maybe we even pray. We ask to understand one day. to understand one day.  I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide.

I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. you  I will give you a little help. I'm sorry.  with the looking. You see the way we search, as usually we use our capacities to find something somebody. When we look for the Self, we look for something that could be called the Self and I. When we look for God, we look for somebody or something.  that could be called God. I will look for mind, we look for something that could be called mind. Our problem is that we always look for something definable. Something which has the character of thingness, something which you know, a place, a color of form, something that you can...  Define. And that brings a lot of problems. It already brings problems if we do this for our partner. If we think she is like that or he is like that and I know. I know him, I know her. Oh, we will soon be wrong.  Because surprise, surprise, different. And this is with everything and everybody the same. Phenomena, whatever you are looking for, which are definable, Cannot be far.  to some extent the outer word gives us a feeling of security there, but only as long as the conditions are stable. A little fire and the table is not a table anymore, just a little change of circumstances. Now all of the more when we look for  more subtle aspects of our experience, the Soul could I or Self, the mind, the Soul, God, love, and so on.  So, when you search for these things, for this person, this somebody, already you will be much more successful if you don't look for something solid.  If you look for the forces which make up that what you are searching. You are not to search for mind, it is a little bit like searching for life. Where do you find life?  Where do you find the weather? We have names for it, but what these names, these words describe? What is it actually? You have the name, I have the name, I will use myself as an example.  put this Timon, this was the name my parents chose. Little baby called him Timon, very nice, very good tour. All this life Timon. Where is this Timon? Been trying to find him. If I look for the somebody  and you do the same for you, you have to put your name now. Here, if you look for that, somebody. Now I am this, then I am that. And then the problem is, not only myself, you, myself experience changes. But then there are so many demons, as people looking at me. And they like me.  One day and they don't like me the other. They seem in the same day in so many different ways. Which one of them am I? It's a little bit crazy what I'm doing with you, but yes, that's what we are talking about. Instead of creating an artificial stability, we become friends with a very dynamic universe. be a part of this denim.  universe. And in this dynamic universe, let's say okay we can talk about energy fields maybe, you know, someone likes modern physics. Okay. We are talking about forces in operation. Forces which group together, that's That's why we can talk about it then.  energy field. Okay. But that doesn't make out of every idea and energy field. We can have ideas so they can go. Nothing is left. Except maybe some impulse which continues from that idea.  So this is the meditators job. The meditators job is coming from a universe already where there were so many questions but somehow things were in place. I am the daughter of So and So and I have learned this and this and her. These are good views, these are not so good views, this is good behavior, this is not so good Okay.  things are pretty much in place. Then we start meditating, and as we meditate, we relax, our awareness becomes more fluid. And we begin to notice the many changes, even without doing anything, just one hour of meditation on the cushion. and we change so much.  within that short period of time, because for different words of experience. Oh, sometimes it's more stable, that's why people like Samadhi, and Samadhi the word is more stable. It looks like that, less input. So people who likes the ability, then they like the janas, things are more stable. you  I also enjoyed them very much. But it's a little bit like a good car which is on the parking. You know, a good car which is not used which can really do lots of things. but in a parking, staying there in Samadhi, the potential of human life is not quite...  It is actually, well, it's a pity. The good thing is that when people come out of the Sammari, they have quite a bit of clarity, so they can look at life and they understand the dynamic nature. And then maybe they open up to that. then maybe there becomes  for en handling dynamic life and being part of that. And that is then the good news. To change from very stable clear mind into very dynamic but also clear mind. To see that the clarity doesn't depend on whether it's active or calm. doesn't depend on that. The clarity that is...  Maybe something stable. It's a quality of mind. And like the other qualities we have talked about. So when we look for the mind, actually we cannot find the mind. We can only find its workings, the workings of minds and the qualities, but the thing which can be called like that, this we cannot find. It's not, it's everywhere and nowhere. Can I say?  that it has a place, a shape and so on. Now when we talk about God, same thing. Let's come back to that. God, Allah, we mentioned in one talk, I, not with you, but I mentioned Tao, you know, in Chinese philosophy, the ultimate Tao. Yes, it's like that non-dual dimension.  also on the nature of mind, call it what you want. Phew! There is an experience there. These words, these names point to experiences. And then there is a lot of grasping around these experiences. many words.  and then philosophies around the world. And if you want to understand the world and all these philosophies, and so you must go back to the experiences, you must go into what was there before the words formed. That's where you find art. So please do this with everything that you're interested in. you  Some people say their life is dedicated to love, others say it's dedicated to peace, some say to justice, some say to friendship, some to simplicity. You name it, it's fine. But then you have to go into the quality behind the words, what is it really? What is it really? Awakening.  Liberation or it's our just words. What is it really? If you can't find a mind, what is a liberated mind?  I've got this not a person. How can he be angry? How can he pardon? How can he be pleased? Maybe there is an experience, what is meant, what is really meant?  And I would say much of this struggle, if not all struggle in the world, comes from careless thinking. Carelessly using concepts like I and self and God and whatever you know, use the other names that you know for it and so on.  and so on, carelessly using them, without feeling into waters behind, without differentiating, without really going into it. This is careless. The Buddha and the Buddhist tradition tries to be careful, and of course, also there sometimes we find, believe.  in words and we find some sectarian tendencies and so we can find that as well. But as a whole there's always this going beyond the words. That is the hallmark of this tradition because it's a tradition of explorers, of of explorers which go beyond the concept of mind.  So, my talk tonight is about that challenging the careless thinking, making you interested in knowing, finding out. And it's not good to have someone tell you all the answers, and then you believe that. Oh no, you don't become really free like that. You have to feel yourself by looking through.  we're looking into all of that. You know, we talk about Mother and Father. And we have like, as if it was clear, what Mother and Father means. Did you ever look into what that really means? How much protection is connected with that? Wow! Our ideas of mothers and fathers they tend to  becomes so fixed sometimes. Look into that. What is brother and sister? Feel into it. All these very dear concepts. Friend and enemy. What does it mean? How stable is that? Which are the forces that make one be a mother?  and another one, another mother, a friend, another friend. What are the energies, the forces, the qualities? You know, go for the dynamic aspect of everything that you want to get to know. Always look behind the seeming solidarity into that which is so alive, so dynamic. We don't have one mother.  We have as many mothers as she has different mental states and as we have different mental different experiences with her. Changing all the time. It's incredible and all of that this person we can call her a mother, we can call her like that, that's fine.  But she is very alive. And if we open like this to everyone and everything we meet, that which seemed so solid before, as if we knew, we are working by a tree maybe every day. First we looked, then we know the tree, we don't look anymore. And one day we stop.  and we look again. At that moment, maybe we see, it has changed. A branch has died. Oh, that is a nest of a bird. Oh, you know? And it is like this, one day we stop. And we look at our mother as if we didn't know her. and we discovered someone we actually didn't know.  She can be new and fresh because we are out of our old patterns of looking at the world. And this is so helpful. This is so interesting this world. This world is incredible when we always have this openness to discover the dynamics behind the seemingly norm. So, of course.  We know, we turn right and left, we go this and that, and we know our way, we say hello, because we know somebody, but the practitioner, in spite of knowing everything just as everybody else, also knows that nothing is ever the same. And that's really...  Maybe it's my play Do I Yeah? This is a word. Do you use that in English language? No. Now do you say this in English? This is my talk and favor of the seventh parameter which is called curiosity. Doesn't exist but I'm very much in favor of declaring it to be a liberating quality. Curiosity. Do wish to know. Yes, I'm an Adler.  look at of elevating curiosity into the rank of equality that leads us beyond. Because that's what an explorer needs to have. And researcher needs to have the curiosity. And We want to know how to be free. And that's the curiosity we want to know.  We want to know how to be alive in this world, how to be of service to this world. We want to understand and we want to understand each other. So we need to be curious. And this can only be from a place of not knowing. about the mind, curious about God and the world.  Curious about every person we meet? Doesn't mean we have to all the time talk and ask questions. Curiosity can be a silent one. A silent curiosity being very receptive to the little changes. the ad-mouse.  Here, sometimes you know a person better by listening to the atmosphere, then by listening to the answers, like this. So I would love to inspire you to be a curious citizen of this universe. We're going to be doing this.  Always interested to learn more. And then life will be fun, and you will also be more and more free. Because the trust, the certainty which we need to be free as to be completely at ease with the  undefinable and the unknown. That's freedom. Not to have a lot of knowledge, but to actually be able to die and to go into the unknown, trusting this ungraspable mind, which nobody We can find, trusting those qualities of life. Yes. Not that about...  that, but it's not knowledge. I hope I make sense to you. It's not an amount of information that we needed, not one knowledge after the other. It is somehow that...  willingness that tries to open to life and not to have, you know, our needs and hooks of security everywhere, you know, our so-called reference points. Yes, how to be without all these reference points. So I hope I could and stimulate your interest a little bit.  In that path, I know I will be silent. I will give meditate together again and this not knowing attitude.  I'm going to go to the next slide.  I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide.

The one thing which is usually helpful is to see whether there is some docker, some stress somewhere. our analysis.  and our little bit of meditation that is to relax that stress.

We have another 15 minutes to go. Maybe some of you want to change position. Stretch a little bit.  And perhaps while you're stretching and moving, moving.  Perhaps spending your head or whatever you are doing, see that all these movements are movements of compassion. This is taking care of oneself. you  The respect to do it in such a way as to not disturb your neighbor is that same compassion, that same loving attention for the other person. It's all there, it's all natural.  And if you look a little bit closer, then in that the way we take care of ourselves and others, there is always the sight of receiving, receiving some information being sent to, to what we feel, what we see.  see what we hear, feeling the body, what we feel emotionally. So there is this sensitivity And then the outgoing sensitivity, which tries to find out what exactly is helpful.  In the same way as we test our, which movement of the body, which posture is most beneficial, the same way our words will test our, which words are most beneficial. And even if you watch a little bit more closely, our thoughts are testing our, what is mass-beneficial.  And this is this constant, constant compassion. There's no better word in English, I'm sorry for that, but is this constant resonance the incoming and the outcoming resonance.  Rest the little world of ours and the larger world around us.

So yesterday I introduced you to another mantra, a money, pay my home, I used the Tibetan pronunciation of this.  a palipon sensation that's written patme for the lotus. The arm means again the wisdom of all awakened ones, calling on to that great awareness of the awakened ones. Money means jewel. It's a jewel. It's a jewel of our own mind. It's a wishful feeling jewel. And the wood out of comes.  how it's the wishful feeling jewel of our own mind in the hands. And Patma means lotus. Patma means the one with the lotus. So the lotus we are talking about is the lotus of buddhichitta. It's the unfolding of that limitless openness towards our sentient being and the awakened mind. and home at the end.  is the insoluble of activity. May the activity of that unfolding of the lotus that shows the wishful feeling jam as the hard mind of all beings be manifest with the blessing of all the awakened ones that would be the translation. We have translations help a little bit, but singing helps more.  So just a little bit of that.

How are the movements? If you do it in physical exercise, yoga, or if you drink something, see that all of that? is that resonance with your own body and then.  taking good care of that. And then see how you're attentive to your surrounding. Like you place your yoga mat there where the arms are not crawling. And this is the compassion for others. This is already it.

    "24.mp3": " Namah Buddha, Namah Dhamma, Namah Sangha, Namah Buddha, Namah Dhamma, Namah Sangha, Namah Buddha, Namah Dhamma, Namah Sangha. This is like saying to the Buddha's, I'm back. I'm here again.  I'm ready to practice. It's one of those days in my life where I will practice. I know how precious this opportunity is. It's one of those days where I will walk in the footsteps off the  previous generations. Walking this path with an open mind, an open heart, fully aware as much as I can.  When I say I'm walking in the footsteps of the Buddha, the Buddha's advice and their hard. It means that I tune in to the deep wisdom and compassion.  So somehow the awareness what I'm breathing in and breathing out changes a little bit. This breathing happens.  There is an intuitive sense of wisdom and compassion. We don't really know what it means, but it's already there.  I sometimes tried to imagine how did my master wake up, how did the Buddha wake up and start the practice. And then I remember they didn't have to practice.  How is it there? They were naturally impractists. And they are these great beings which walk the earth. how is it to be in full awareness without practicing?  Thank you.  As we are being told by many of them, it is as simple as that breathing in and breathing art. It happens by itself. and then kick a cup of tea.  And that's that. There is a constant sense, a constant awareness that all of this is happening in mind.  And these wonderful beings, they are completely aware that the mind as such cannot be found. you  It's only a word. What is meant with this word?  What does men when the Buddha says that all the you  the different worlds are created by the mind. How do I create this world? I haven't built these words. I was there to be understood. How do I create my world right now?  Oh.  When contemplating such questions, there is no need to answer with the intellect. Those answers you already know. you  Try to fear just how right now it's happening.  you  you  Breathing in and breathing out and feeling just how much this is an experience of consciousness of my own too.  you  Maybe you sense this and when we say that feeling, the physical sensations all over the body is mind, that somehow we are more in it, we separate less.  Then when we say this is body, somehow this operation becomes less.  It helps us to fear from within, within the experience. become mind-morrow the experience.  I invite you to walk a little bit through your body with your mindfulness. you  into all the different places, and to be the experience of course without attachment and then to learn that solidifying it, just being this flowing awareness, Explore  all the various possible sensations in the body.  you  you  you  And of course, and of course  Please include the healing. Most of you are practicing with closed eyes. You can also include the seeing. Just... The focus is not on what we see and how we see. It actually...

I'm sorry.  And better of course more aspects, and this is smelling at the tasting. And there is this final awareness of just what's going on, and the thinking processes, impulsive mind.

This flowing awareness, and then this overall awareness, our attention goes sometimes more and this area and that area. Maybe you can feel that. Then sometimes the attention to...  mind forness set to it somewhere. The overall awareness continues.  Thank you.  you  you  you  Sometimes active, sometimes calm, same mind.  you  you  you  you  It is always good to make a little pause. while you stretch and perhaps change position.

Ready to start the...  And why there is this subtle experience of resonance, that is the awareness of the the ungraspable nature of all of what is happening.  There is this space, this space is awareness that allows for everything to arise and deserve for that's all nature.  This capacity to resonate is the grant of compassion. you  It's another quality of mind. It is very fine and precise. It's a different shade.  And because it is one with wisdom, it does not cling.

That is this fluid quality, this continuity of awareness. you  This dynamic experience of being flowing on very precisely experienced, you  It never standings to for a moment. that is this experience of interbeing.  of resonance, seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting, smelling. And of course, right now the resonance to the words that you hear and understand.  For me, the resonance of seeing you feeling you a little bit. and usually there are reactions to what we fear, what we experience.  It's the more active side of resonance. The more active side you could say of compassion.  This is normally reactive in the sense of me interpreting. And basically all these thoughts, all these reactions, this dynamic side of mind. expressions of our search for happiness.  It is good to see that what we usually call distraction are the many fault ways in which research for happiness, trying to become clear with our life to sort it out. and so including of course all our tech.  tendencies of day dreaming, trying to reconfort ourselves by thinking a little bit more, and we feel shaky. And maybe you fear that when this self-concern relaxes, then still there.  thoughts arising. Still there are movements.  If the self-concern completely relaxes and the senses stay open, then this will be the active side of compare  Now we use it to compassionately detect our attention. There are where it is most also. For example to simply breathing in and out because we feel that's really good. It helps me to simplify it to just be.

    "25.mp3": " It also means you never start a conversation with talking on politics and things like that. It will mean the first words of the conversation, they need to be Dharma. They need to come from their heart and they connect to the heart of the other person. So I think in your cultures, the various cultures you are coming from, you have the same and we shouldn't lose that and wish.  should cultivate that. It's a wonderful way of doing. So, after the meditation, when I do like this, I think maybe it's the same meaning for you, I bow down to your Buddha nature and I say thank you to you. Yes, this is why at the end of a meditation, I do like this, and the Buddhist tradition is very often done like that. So  you can give it the meaning you like, but just so that you... Because some of the notes they are asking about these meanings, so I answer to some of the questions that you put. And as Lila so beautifully said, there's a lot of silence between the words and behind the words. So I invite you...  to come back to the meditation of this morning. There is a lot of silence in the hearing. We can only hear because there is enough silence around. If there is only noise, we cannot hear. The mind can only think because there is enough  What? To think if it was crowded, no, but there is space, mind is of that nature, healing has silence and there is this capacity to be aware all the time. Now this morning, we will call that morning meditation. It was actually a meditation on.  All appearances are mine, that would be the title of the morning meditation. And this would be the title also of now what I'm going to teach. And it is sometimes difficult to teach this in a culture like ours. and all of this European, Greek and so on, Middle East.  culture, there has been so much of a split between minds and matter. The split between mind and matter is enormous. And you might hear when the Buddhist teaching says everything is mind, then you hear like it is not real. Oh no, this is not the meaning, please. In your notebook,  Cross out and say, this doesn't mean it's not real. Actually, it means whatever we know about this world, whatever we experience, that which is our world. This is mind. So I'm not saying that my mind has created this world. No, stupid. Mine does not created you with also mischievousness.  No, no, no. My mind creates the way I perceive the world when I touch it. When I hear the sound it gives, when I look at it, this is mind. Okay, not the wall is mind. Okay, this is not negating a reality that could be outside the mind but it is saying that all I'm  So, about that reality happens in my mind. The tree which I don't see is not in my mind, right? It's not part of my world. I ignored it. However, I cannot say it's not there because you can bump your head against it. So I'm not going to say because it's not in my mind, it's not in my world that something doesn't exist. you  very important to understand. Everything that comes to be an experience in our mind, even if it is information coming through computers. This is sensory information. Even if it comes in the digital way, some decoded sounds from the universe, some decoded light waves from the galaxy is, you know, all of that it enters.  our world by sensory experience. We see it, we hear it, we think about it, we construct our world with that information. That what we think about the outer world, we must admit although it is quite reliable, still is a hypothesis. It is not the absolute truth. it is.  that which makes the most sense. For example, most of us we live in a world of believing things to be solid, you know, like a wall of solid, which is absolutely not the case from the poorest of view, point of view of modern physics. We know that that is particles coming through the galaxy, from the universe, they traverse the whole planet.  Earth without even being slowed down. Solidarity, this is not solidarity. There seems to be a lot of space and we know from research, from physics that the space between the moving subatomic particles is as big as the space between the stars.  then moving feeds of energy. It's incredible. The solidity is actually energy. Okay, so much said for our hypothesis of the real world. Fortunately we can rely on science today to to kind of challenge our projection of solidity. We know that it is only true for as much these conditions and  not shaken up. When they change drastically, if the temperature rises to 2000 degrees, you know, all of this melts away. Everything becomes lava. Yes? Okay. So, ends so on, ends so on. Circumstances changing and that's seeming so solidity as God. And then where of our word, what has our word gone? Okay? So...  Here, the Buddhist teachings are, this is fantastic, you know, you cannot imagine the insights of these great meditators of the past. It's incredible like this, this Kampupa, one of the Mahamudra masters, how he described the embryonic development without ever doing a dissection, you know, knowing exactly the different stages of how an  embryo develops in the womb and so on, describing that in writing. Yeah, I was translating this passage in one other text. And the third camera, for example, feeling so connected in his interbeing that he felt the whole solar system and more great a part of the galaxy in his own body so precisely That's it developed a killer.  from that. Exactly giving the timings of the days and months and this calendar is still used today. So precisely, he knew from the way the planets were moving in his own sensitivity. So just to tell you, when these masters say that the world, the appearances are mind, they know what they are talking about. They know that we know as much of...  of this world as comes to our awareness. And this is something very helpful. It does not negate matter. We know that matter is energy. Okay, we know that. It does not negate any outer reality, but it is saying the reality I perceive is are those forces that manifest in my mind. for  It does not manifest in our consciousness, it is not part of my world. You can think as loud as you want, you can create shouting thoughts in your mind, since I don't perceive them, if I don't perceive them, they are not part of my world. However, if I were to perceive them, then they become...  of my word. So depending on what enters my consciousness, my word becomes larger, smaller, includes more aspects, includes less aspects, you know. And the practice of meditation, especially if you talk about a buddhist Satva, a person who wishes to be there for the whole world,  who offers to be there for the whole world, then the practice includes to open up to more and more words of experience, but they have to become a personal experience. So it doesn't stay outside. There is no such thing as an emotion that I feel that belongs to somebody else. No, no, no, it is arising in my mind. So the resin...  when you look into your face, the resonance of what you feel arises in my mind. It becomes an experience in my world. So, we deal with it as our own world. We don't create a split within, like my emotion and your emotion, which I can also feel, but that better stays out. Or I take only of what I like. I take your love, but not your anger. No, no, no, no, everything, everything.  that we feel is this word that we call mind. Okay, so this mind, we cannot find, it's a word. It's a noun in the English language, substantive noun, means seemingly describing something stable. Fortunately, sometimes in English language, we also use the verb to mind. Usually we note in the context.  mind your own business. Yeah, but minding means to place one's attention somewhere, here to go with one's awareness somewhere. And I've heard from here my two sisters that the language, the Hebrew language now I'm talking about is similar to Tibetan language and using a lot of verbs. So maybe you can use a verb for mind, which is...  describing the process and same and other language and whatever other language you might be familiar with, please Think of mind as a process. It's mind-ding. It's a wearing. It's being aware. Yeah, it is it is It's like in German When I teach the Dharma, I don't talk so much about thoughts. I talk about thinking I'm going to do it again.  instead of Gedankin. And this is the process language. So when we want to understand our experience, it's very important that we get away from solidifying words like conscious Ness, when in English there is Ness at the end, it becomes really solid. Like solidity. It's like, yeah, so you have this ending.  things which make things solid. If you can in your own way of thinking, if you can, when you observe how it is, if when you make comments about it, for example, there is this vibrational practice of labeling, then don't say thoughts, but say thinking. Yes? And when you say, instead of saying anger, anger, that maybe you'll say...  rather being angry. Yeah, angry thinking or something like this. Yeah, it's like very important that when you observe your own mind, that you're aware, that why you're observing it and why you're labelling it, it changes, it continues to be processed. It is never anything else but processed. So what we call mind is the mind thing. It's this being aware. And this  That is this continuity. This then you come closer to understand how the minding process can actually continue even when the so-called mind, when the minding process is not connected to a body anymore at the time of leaving this body. The process just continues, but without creating that connection to this energy.  which we call body, which is also not solid, it will disintegrate the moment it's not inhabited anymore. It's not stimulated, the causes are not there for it to continue, it will disintegrate. It will become what it always was. So this is very important to, when you look, when you investigate mind, to see, Oh! That's why I cannot find.  the mind because there's only minding, there's only awareness, being in the flow of experience sin. Yeah, it's like, wow, and this is so important. So when we realize that all of what we call the word is our experiencing and it is connected Too many.  processes, processes that together make up this ongoing experiencing. So that is the perceiving aspect, that is the feeling aspect, there is the differentiating aspect, there is the creating aspect, this is what the Buddha called Sanskara, karma, karma means to be active, to create.  to create an effect. And so there is the ongoing process of creation in this minding. Yes, I'm describing all the sub-processes. So in this whole process that we would call being aware. Now then come in forces interpreting interpreting.  interpreting the incoming experiences, interpreting them in the light of our previous experiences. So you will interpret your experiences in the light of your biography, and I will interpret them in the light of my biography, and we come to a different world. Yes, we come to be living, although we share the same room.  We come to live all the time, the experiencing, continuous influence by our personal interpretations and so on. Yeah, it continues in such a way that we have as many words as we have people and living beings. And they are all mind. And this is a quote from the winner. Here, all ramps of existence, all ramps of existence.  in some mind. And this famous question also, who has created the heads? Only mind. The only, the hell rhymes, the hellish suffering. Yes, who has created this hellish suffering? Who has created psychosis? Who has created depression? Who has created love? It's always, It's always the so-called-  mind, but it is a minding process. It is the way of shaping reality. We have in the English, we have what we call the Jirundium, these ing forms, shaping to shape as the world and the ING form, the ing form, the making is even more fluid than to make, making the the process of making.  process of perceiving. So with these words, the English language underlies, underlines the process nature of what is happening. And this is what we need to be very much aware of when we observe our own mind. I come back to normal language now to make it a little bit easier. We need to be really conscious that when we...  When we observe our experience, look at this beautiful gap. Can you feel the minding in the gap? Can you feel how your consciousness continues to be aware that being aware continues can they?  And the silence, this is very important. The mind does not need to change from activity to calm mind and become a different mind. active mind of listening and talking. Continuous  without any discontinuity in the mind of waiting, of just being, and comes back to listening again. So, without any need to be told, there is no need for an I, a self, to tear the mind now please  switch on your activity, I need you to think. And now please switch off because I need you to be silent. It happens by itself. It's an incredible thing. So when we begin to investigate mind, minding, we see all these processes. And sometimes no processes accept A very b-  We will take the vivid awareness, continuing. Something very simple, so simple, as if you were listening to the space between the stars.  And then comes the star. And then space. And actually, and now comes the next discovery. First, we have this, here's a thought. But... Who... Something happening?  And then nothing happening. So we make a difference between what is happening, activity, like a word, mother, father. And then each word, each idea has little waves. Oh, mother, no. And then there is so to speak silence, where there is no...  and we fear as if there was more space in the silence than in the thinking. This is the first idea the meditator has that the space is to be found on the non-thinking side. Yes? When does the space go when you listen?  So when you listen now to me, your thinking is that true? You're probably thinking. I mean, how would you understand what I say if you were thinking? Does the space go somewhere else? When the sound comes and the understanding happens.  If you create a thought for yourself, dark, moon, whatever, the space doesn't change. Somehow that what we call the contents of awareness. and now the tiles to move when the impals is  emotions, you know? All of them doesn't make the space leave. The space doesn't have to go away to give its space to something that is not space. It's very interesting. In the Mahamudra, one of the important practices is to discover that space within the same insolidity of thinking. I'm sorry.  of minding, of sensations, of all of that. Would you say when a rainbow arises in space, would you say that it takes away from the space? You think it takes away?  When the lights from the sun are reflected on the two particles, does the light take space? How is that? Does electricity take space? Thank you.  Does energy take space? You have to think, there is clever, clever thoughts, clever questions. You know, it gives you a little bit of answer already.  The space retracts in our experience when we think because there is clinging to the thinking process. It's the clinging, it's the grasping, the identification which makes the felt space smaller. We feel like we are... everything is nettering down because there is fixation. But if you allow for  thinking, feeling, to arise without the clinging. You know like the cinema we talked about yesterday night, the active mind manifesting this enormous cinema, the space doesn't become any smaller. It's right there. We call that the empty nature of appearances.  This is what I am talking about, the ungraspable nature, no substance. And you will, yeah, you will, I am just indicating to you because I am bringing to you maybe a new way of looking at reality. So I am making many pointers right now. Yes, I am giving you a little help to find the way. first here.  Now for us, if you can follow me, that our world, the world we live in, our subjective world, would you agree that this is mind? It is an experience. If you say yes to this world I live in as an experience, then you agree that it is a mind.  that this is mind. Yes? So the word I live in is the experience of the word. Now I do project in my mind a seemingly outer word. This is also this seemingly outer world, the way you imagine now Tel Aviv or Beirut or whatever town to be, you know.  You don't know if it is still like that. It is your own personal idea. It has probably changed. Details have changed. There may be big things have changed. When I imagine my home now, my room, my garden, I have my projection about it. But that's not the reality out there. It's the world in which I live. And when I come back, I have to check with my sense.  with my eyes, with my senses, I have to check. And then I will have a new representation of what is my room and my garden and so on. Here's it, the world continues to evolve with all the sensory impressions, including what I read and hear, the discussions, or everything continuously gives rise to my own subjective world. I demand subject  word, then the things are like that. And then I'm surprised that in this subjective word of someone else, it's not like that. And that's where friction comes from. Now if both sides are aware that they are in their own word and that their word is not something that is reliable because it's it's fabricated.  personal fabrication, it cannot be a group fabrication, but it's a fabrication. So now one of the two or the three or the five and so on claims that my world is the right one, then communication can start. Then the inner fluidity of not clinging to my worldview to the way of seeing reality by this process that they call me.  when this happens, then very fluid communication can happen. Oh, you see it like this, you experience it like that's interesting. And then words meet, there's communication, and why they communicate, they change. Because, of course, what they hear from you will influence me. I begin to see a little bit with your eyes and because you hear how I see the things you see in this.  with my eyes and with my heart. And like this, words are influencing each other, but they are never solid, never. It's just how much we fix on them as being true. And this fixation on my word being true, this is what I call view. It's drishti, M.  Sanskrit. It is one of the six root kleshars. It is the belief that things are like that and not different. And to be liberated, to awaken means to become free from any view that the world is like that and only like that. To not hold on to views means  to completely enter flexible mind, to be really fluid in the constant co-creation of our words. Yeah, this is like, we are entering this beautiful understanding that, okay, but I consider my word actually has undergone so many influences and is constantly undergoing so many influences Am I...  Open to that? Is it okay? Or do I want to hold on? And with all means, I want to hold on to my worldview. And then, of course, the conflict is programmed. Because it will hit with the worldview of my partner. Or the people I live together with, the people I share this planet with. because  holding on to me and my, my world, my world view, is not an accordance with reality. Reality is fluid. It's the result of so many conditions interacting. It's a conditioned experience of living beings, each one, subjectively interpreting what is going on on this pad planet.  And anything, anybody who comes there, it is like this, and only like that, is going to be in conflict. It's programmed. It cannot be different. The basic teaching on this, by the Buddha, is that this person imposing his or her worldview is not ensued with impermanence. It's very simple. Whenever someone is not enthroned with change, with impermanence, and I'm only talking  about that. The whole thing I'm explaining is only impermanence. But if one imposes, like something eternally being like this, conflict, because the world is perceived differently by others, the world is changing, there is constant need for adaptation, it never stands there. So an awakened being and this concord's very much with modern psychology.  is a being with a Supreme degree of flexibility, a Supreme degree of this capacity of adaptation. Incredibly open to other ways of seeing the world, why not believing a single one? Okay, it's all cinema.  Yes, it's all subjective world view, it's a different way of saying the thing, a little bit nicer. It's okay, subjective way of perceiving the world. If you put it in short words, that means it's my own cinema. And this we need to look through and now I've only talked about this side.  which is a little bit, you can say, well, it wakes me up to my delusion, how confused, how ignorant I am, because I have often been fighting over minor issues with other people. I have been a little bit stubborn, Yeah, thickheaded, you know? Okay, I've been dissent that and if I...  I realized, oh, I could have done differently. My whole life could have gone much smoother. If I had listened a little bit more, if I had been less convinced of my ways of seeing things, then it could have been easier. Maybe I wouldn't have had my first day divorce. Maybe even not even not my second. And then yes, it's like this. and maybe my...  We didn't would have grown up, you know, with a little bit more confidence that I listened to them, but that never listens, you know, like this. So this is all about understanding that all appearances are minding, are mind, yes? Whatever we know about the Dharma, the knowing, the understanding.  is also dynamic. The enlightenment is also dynamic. It's a constant flow of awakened experiencing. It's an experiencing without clinging. The flow, the continuity of of being aware, continues. However, without all these blockages, all...  these clinging coming in. So the whole thing becomes more fluid, since there is no clinging to views, there is much more permeability, much more interchange with the surrounding. All of that is a very beautiful process of being alive in this world. There is no enlightenment, which is booked, experienced, and that's it. It's an ongoing XP.  of enlightenment manifestation in this world. It's constantly in this interbeing. It is constantly continuing. And now I come to the very interesting side. It is creative. Now look, the beautiful other side of the coin. One side of the coin is we see our delusion and how much we got stuck so often in our life in our opinions and so on.  or views, not being aware that it is a very subjective issue, that's the one thing. I think that I'm right and I see no. Okay. The other side is, now that I understand this, that everything is mind. Huh, that's where I have the greatest influence. I want to change the world. How about working with my mind? How about  changing the minding process. How about that in this continuity of being aware? Now the interest goes to motivation, focuses our attention, our mindfulness, in those areas that are really making happy, and they create happiness for others. Focusing in those areas that open up to more understanding.  The open up to this wise compassion, this compassionate wisdom, hey, with this understanding that everything is mind, I have at least my word and my hands. I can do something about it. This is the opening door to understanding how I can put an end to suffering. This is exactly where it happens. When I understand that my personal drama is the way that this...  process of being interprets, different sensory phenomena, I can do something about it. And that's where the Buddha says, karma, this means creation, through thinking, speaking and physical action. This is what we call the three levels of karma of creation. This is in my hands and this is my refuge. Hey, so far it was my prison.  And now it is the solution. As long as there wasn't a way that my samsara, my world with all that suffering, was actually continuously being produced by this mind blindly following its habitual patterns, then I was actually suffering. I understand that the same process.  of continuously creating the words I experienced that this can be used in a skillful way. Not going into all that clinging, identification, holding onto views and opinions and so on, but following the real qualities, being and embodying those qualities, letting these qualities Give the dynamic expression in this mind. Then this  same world in which I live becomes Nirvana. This is again what I was talking about, I think today is a go, three days ago, but the identity, the unity of some certain Nirvana, it because it's mind. And since mind is dynamic, then those who use carefully the dynamics of being aware.  They have their happiness, their freedom in their hands, their mind. Yes, this is so wonderful. This is great. And this is where this famous capacity of sati comes in. Remember the Sati Patana Sutra where the Buddha says, there's only one way, and this is where I took the name of our institute from. There's only one way Ikayana.  And this is Sati. Sati means how we direct our awareness. Where the attention goes. This is the key to awakening. Because the whole experience of suffering is mind, and the whole experience of awakening is mind. And the difference is where the awareness goes.  Where the attention goes? This is the key. Now, on the basis of this, what the Satti Patana Sutra says, you know, this is really the key point of that whole teaching. Satti is the key to awakening this, no other way. And then what directs Satti? What is actually the driving force that directs the attention? the mic.  mindfulness. You know, the mindfulness of a robber goes into the studying the plans of the bank and how to get in and out without being caught. So that mindfulness is not going to awaken. So what makes it that our mindfulness goes towards awakening? And I heard something whispered here, Was it you? The intention. Yes.  behind sati, that is an intention. So now I quote another sutra, but in Mayana sutra is the famous lotus sutra. The lotus sutra, the Buddha says, there is only one way to awakening, a kayaana, again, same word, buddhichitta. And this means then the motivation plus the mind.  So it is the motivation of compassion of being open for all sentient beings plus the insight into reality. That is the key, the one way to awakening. It's only a more thorough explanation of what sati means because there is of course an abidama, the way then sati is defined that it must be directed to the whole world. directed to the whole  Otherwise, we won't call it sati, we will call it simply attention. Yes? So when we talk about the sati, the mindfulness of the Dharma, it is always directed towards deliberation and awakening of all. That is the way to take our life into our hands. by using this mind, this minding.  process constantly to go into that which is most helpful. And different moments of our day, we find different aspects more helpful. For example, you were doing before breakfast, you were doing maybe some physical exercises. Here you were maybe doing something wrong or yoga and then at that moment  you found it most helpful to be with feeling the body, but of course your sati could go into doing the arsanas with a lot of love, a lot of compassion for yourself and even being motivated to keep your body healthy for the benefit of others. So not just body mindfulness, but already bodhicitta with body mindfulness. Yes.  And like this, you can use all examples of what we have been doing today. Everywhere you have a motivation, which directs your intention. You were choosing your food for breakfast. And you were choosing to the best of your capacity to please this body, to nourish it, and maybe with the intention that it stays healthy for the benefit of all.  like this. And you do everything like this. I know I'm wrong. You do everything like this with this wonderful understanding that everything is mind. Continuation later on.  Ganati, banana, papaya, sea pants and leg. To ash. The city betonwish saying, may all beings be liberated from the ocean of suffering, which is, I just... I just say which is... Like a stormy...

    "31.mp3": " And I would like to welcome someone who tries to sneak in without being noticed. He is sitting there towards the window, our dear Stephen, and it is thanks to Stephen and that I am here. We knew each other from before, and the Stephen and Lila came to Switzerland.  At the end of October, I think it was and that's why I'm here. So I'm really happy that yes, the founder of this place, for those who don't know him, that the founder of this place gives us the honor to share the meditation with us, practice. And I'm obviously sitting in the place where he would usually sit. I guess so.  So I'm really honored and want just to pay my respect to my elders, those people who have been talking about the generations that are always taking care all over the world that the Dharma continues. to reach always new people and then this way continuing through the  ages and Stephen has taken care of that. Stephen has taken care, like he says so beautifully, he steps aside but he doesn't step out. You know, it's like he's there and sees the things that are developing well. So, all my gratitude for this. You made a beautiful place here and this whole atmosphere this  Open atmosphere is very inviting. And since we are sitting here with a little bit of informal talk, you know that I came here really with the wish to learn, to learn from you and not to take science, but to share deep dharma with you. and it has been my prayer also to a maid palace.  So that seems to be happening now. That is possible probably on Sunday I will meet with some of the Palestinian people involved at the mindfulness and Dharma movement. We are trying to set up the situation and I'm very touched about that because we are all one. We are like everyone is searching for happiness, everyone is so desperate.  for peace actually. And I cannot help with that, but I can be someone, you know, coming from the outside and showing that nobody is forgotten. And while the world gets splits, it gets into splits about whole contra, you know, foreign against and so on. We are more Sattar we try to touch the Buddha nature and everybody.  And actually it's on that level, on the deepest level of relaxed being together. That is where we can actually share and conter it, and we have so much to share. Just to start with the most obvious, we have a beautiful planet to share. So we have that. We have these resources to share which make it possible for this precious human life.  You know, it's amazing. We have to share so much. And we have love to share if we go on. We have friendship to share. And as you know, then the more generosity there is, the more friendship there is, the more it grows. It never gets less. It just grows. And when I was young, I thought that I wasn't so sure how, How many?  people one can love. I wasn't so sure. You know, I came out of my seven years of retreat and my teacher asked me to take care of the first two retreat groups for the next three years and three months and wow, I had to open my heart for these thirty men. I was taking care of men and and the women will take care of their women. And, wow, I hope.  opened my heart and shared my love with them. And then after three and a half years, I was asked to take care of four retreat groups of the same size. And then I kind of needed to double the space in my heart, so to speak, to take in the very personal life and practice of more people. And at that time, you know, remember I taught you, I was 34 and then 37 when the next step happened I'm sorry.  I discovered that with the same intensity as I was loving my partner before and now being among, being with my own retreat group, then I could be with the first two to guide, then they would continue and two more were added. So wow, and then this process never stopped. And this so called heart, this heart mind is actually...  able to love without limits. And I wasn't sure about that before. I really wasn't sure. And I was already a practitioner for many years with intensive practice, but life had to show that. I needed to learn from life. And then now I know that just like the mind is this, this, you know, this unhanded, unhanded play of phenomenal.  like a mirror, you know, we were talking about that this fluidity, this unhindered manifestation, that this is not only, you know, for like abstract thinking and, you know, thoughts and sensations can arise, but as many movements of love can arise without any movement depleting the mind, but actually always making it more ready for the next movement of love to arise. So.  So actually there is always the possibility to open a little more. Just let's not get stuck on the previous movement. It's always happening and sometimes it's closing again. Fear comes back. And then again it can open. So, wow, we can breathe with this kind of...  openness with this love and there has been a very loving contact with you in the last days. And you responded so incredibly to each other and to the Dharma and so on. So we are going much further in sharing the Dharma and the depths of the teaching then our original thought would be possible. So we are actually .  I'm actually finding that we can go even further. So further means becoming more subtle. Let's take refuge now and then I will talk more because now it seems that the teaching starts. Right? Now we'll bridge.  Namodama namo sanga namo Buddha namo dalma namo sanga namo Buddha namo dama namo sanga And you remember this morning how I quickly translated it into other words? Namo Buddha Nature, Namo Truth which liberates.  Namu, brothers and sisters all over the world. Yes, you can remember that, you know, improvised meaning of what a balance. So in the past days we have established the ground. We have established the attitude of Motivation.  We have shared about the four measurements and how they become the bodhicitta, that they are really limitless, they are really limitless in time and space and quantity. And we have established these, these warmth of their heart with ourselves, Seeing that actually every thought, every movement is an experience.  of compassion. I have looked into that and I asked you before going into the pause, into the exercises or whatever you were doing to keep a little eye on that, to see how actually every way, the way you stretch, the way you move, where you put your mat and so on, everything is an expression of that care. And then as you were taking your breakfast and shedding the room, I mean the...  and the dining room and then outside, there's always this interaction with the surrounding. So there is a natural care, a natural respect. And we know that the place which is taken by someone else, we cannot take. We sit somewhere else, we respect the ants and so on. So this is like we are on this ground.  We have started to work a little bit with this receptive side of ourselves, this resonance, which is a sensitivity of feeling, of being sensitive towards, is there in us and around, you know, without even making a clear distinction between inside outside, it's just in our I'm sorry.  awareness of the situation, there is a sensitivity for how it is. And then there is an active side of that, which is the response. It is the resonance which then gives out an interaction, a thought, an image, a gesture, and so on. So there is this natural sharing, receiving kind of not only information, It's more, you know, we have...  subtle antenna where we feel and the feeling, you cannot say it is only a receptive form. Actually when you start feeling someone or a situation, the interaction already begins. When you feel a person, the person feels felt and already the interaction is there. So you don't need to wait.  much for the second step which will come when you start talking or when you move together, when you look into each other's eyes and so on. Then there is more interaction. But the interaction with the environment is already there when we allow for that resonance to happen. We can be sure of that. Why do I say this? Because you can see it with the animals.  When you approach an animal that is more or less relaxed, not in a fearful state, then that animal feels whether you are in resonance and how much you are in it, and it creates a different atmosphere. It will decide for itself. It doesn't mean that it has to come towards you. it feels just...  If it's safe, if it's okay, maybe there is the purring of the cat as you pass by, you know, it's like, ah, you know, there's already this resonance and don't think that the birds don't notice you. When you sit out there under the tree meditating, the birds notice very well that you are sitting under the tree. And they chirp a little bit differently. They purr a little bit differently. You know the pigeons, the purring.  of the pigeons. Yes, it's like, and so on. And and some of them they start actually singing with us for us, interacting. And it's quite amazing when you when you enter that resonance, how the user universe actually resonates with us. So we are in this, I repeat myself, we're and this interbeing very much.  Now in this interbing, in this interdependence, then actually because of underlying fears and hopes and so on, then at times we have what we call emotions. The difficult ones, the afflictive emotions, they are called clashes in the...  kilesha and paali kilesha and sanskrit they are they are actually what stops us from being our natural self it's that which is like a little handicap but basically they are movements of compassion okay emotions they are actually the expression of wanting to be happy When I get angry.  It's because I feel this, will not allow me to be happy. I have to destroy it, drive it out of my life, I have to change it. And there is a positive side to that anger, which is wanting to change something that doesn't seem to be so helpful for happiness. And you can be angry for something that is not even your business, your ankle.  about something that infringes on the happiness of others. And you become angry for that because it doesn't allow these people to be happy, or that animal to be happy. You know? It's like you, it doesn't, it's not only self-concern. Of course, we say sometimes and it's a little bit short-sighted. We say then often we hear this in the Dharma.  that we identify with the other person, that this is another form of ego-clinging, when we get angry for another person. You know, but actually behind that identification with the other person, or that any of which is, for example, mistreated, then there is also compassion. There's also this love. We are in resonance with what we think this other being is...  experience thing, we are in a resonance with that and we just don't know better how to react to that injustice and that what we observe and that relation. We don't know better than to react with a very strong angry reaction which wants to drive out that which seems to be so difficult to bear.  So in my understanding of the Dharma in those last years, then I found it to be helpful that wherever we talk about the clinging to a seeming self, ego centered attitude, attitudes, that we see the part of which is compassion. It seems to be very, very helpful.  And if we work a little bit more with emotions, then we need to see that part of every emotion. Of course, it also goes for the wholesome states of mind, because as well for love, generosity, and so on. Yes, for nonviolence and so on. This is easier than to see the tell us a big part of love and compassion.  there, but there's also clinging. There's usually a good part of identifying with it. So also there, we encourage that aspect that is really helpful or that wants to be of help, and we look for more careful ways of being happy. Basically that's what Dhamma is about.  We look for more skillful ways of finding a lasting happiness. A happiness that is not dependent, so much dependent on circumstances, on conditions. So the unscrupulous part of all of our afflictions, of our emotions that create suffering, is  that they are usually too short-sighted, they don't take an account, the long-term effects of encouraging desire, of living and pride, of, you know, competitive mind and so on, they don't see what this does with us. It's like short-sighted, seems to give some good result already.  You have to be very long vision. You say already in the medium range, you know, within a very easily observable time, you see that it's actually not good for us to be in the spirit of competition and desire and a version of all of that. You know, pride, I mean, pride feels nice when you're in it, but when you look at yourself and others, You see so quickly that it is not...  the most pleasing state of mind. So all of that actually we would say are unskillful ways of dealing with the challenges in this world. And they are based on a lack of awareness, a lack of understanding this world, understanding life.  And this is what is usually translated as ignorance. But maybe you add the word lacking awareness, because in Sanskrit it's our video. And this r does not mean necessarily non-awareness. It's not necessarily a complete negation, but it means lacking. So, there can be a way.  but it's not complete. There can be understanding, but it's not going deep enough. So, this lack of awareness is not that we lack information. It's not that these ignorance can be cured by reading more books. To some extent the books, the teachings will open our eyes and actually what they do is They help us.  to enhance awareness, our sensitivity, this is to say, awareness is all about this sensitivity, the capacity to finally experience in a very subtle way to experience just how it is. This is calling on our intuitive capacities.  What we call awareness, this deep awareness, is not a conceptual process. It is intuitively but very clearly getting the taste of just how it is. It is tasting is a good way to describe that. It is tasting into the atmosphere.  And like when I asked you to look into the mind, I did that yesterday, but we did it a few times. Then often the text says that you see the openness, you see the empty nature, you see the impermanence. but actually we feel it, we taste it. If we talk too much about seeing it so much connected with the visuals.  sense and the visual sense actually is very dualistic the way we normally use it. So here when I say feeling and tasting we go to senses, images, these are only images, these are only images point us to the moon. So this, this, the image of tasting openness, you see how it does with you? and then when I see it with...  see the open nature. We taste it, which is impossible. Somehow by using an impossible verb, how can you taste openness? How can you taste fluidity? It's like impossible, but because it is impossible, it is like a poem. It is a poetic way of showing or this behind  the words. So I invite you, I will invite you also in the guided meditations to taste kind of behind the emotions, to taste already the compassionate attempt in every emotion. this love, this wish for happiness to already feel that. We already...  talked about the fear. I hope you remember how we had fear as one of our examples. And we went into the fear being actually a very wise and compassionate reaction of the organism to protect from something that endangers our health, our emotional stability, our friends.  And so on. But we took the example of walking across the bridge. You also remember that? This typical swinging Tibetan bridge with the planks of wood. And you could feel that fear when you're going to cross a bridge like that is not the most careful way to take care. You want to reach the other side. You need to cross that bridge.  Now, careful attention, why is relaxed mindfulness with every step, which would mean in our case with every thought, with every movement of the mind. This is so much more helpful than to get blocked and fear. That will make us shiver, that will make us tremble and we might unnecessarily lose the balance on the bridge.  And the bridge is a very nice image because these bridges which go over the, which cross the canyons, these ravines or ravines, yes, they cross over something which is, here going deep down, wins the feeling to maybe get lost.  and get hurt. Something really dreadful could happen when I fall into that. Now this is yet another aspect of emotions. We also need to first understand because if we start working head on with emotions, we don't see what they protect us from. All emotions.  have a function of protecting us from a state of being where we don't know. Where the emotion comes in, actually it is the dualistic reaction of moving into a situation with desire, with hatred, with fear, with competition, where if we were to let...  go, we wouldn't quite know how to handle the situation, how to be in that. So let me give you one of the nicer examples, how we fall in love. Okay? There is this openness, there is this very inspiring encounter with someone, and this Inspiration is great. Now this inspiration.  touches us. It makes us, if we allow it to happen, it makes us very naked, vulnerable. Yeah, you feel that? It's this woof feeling. And it is difficult for us to stay in that open, inspired dimension where we don't really know who we are.  and who is the other person? Yeah, it's like, yes, so if you can, you breathe in that, you allow it to be without jumping in, oh, I want to meet you again, can we make a date and so on? And then thinking about the person and thinking about what you will dress when you meet next time, and so on. All the activities.  of falling in love, which is actually this falling in love, a mechanism is actually a way of securing us in a relationship that has the potential to destabilize us. And this mechanism, which you can see so well in the relationship, this is the same with the angle takes off.  for the helplessness, for not knowing how to deal with that uncomfortable experience. So to drive it out is like filling the space of that not knowing. Again, this not knowing every time this not knowing is this lack of awareness. Yeah, and we are the...  The dualistic movement of mind comes in as a safety mechanism to kind of make our world stable in this dualistic functioning with desire and anger and pride and computational you know jealousy, with the hopes and the fears, then we have our world. Yeah, it's like the relationships are clear. If we were...  to relax those movements, the word doesn't look so clear anymore. We would not be able to hold on to such clear opinions. We would feel more and various ways of looking at the situation would be possible. We could even look at  from the point of view of the other person or of many other. This would be a new flexibility which makes us enter something which you could call a groundlessness. Yes, yeah, grandless feeling. And this is where the bridge comes in. Yeah, this steep canyon.  going deep below is like a nice way of talking about groundlessness. So actually working with emotions, with this understanding, we have two very different Taste to it. That is a taste of knowing this this amount of  will be action to be an act of compassion of searching for happiness. And there is an understanding that it is covering up a fear of the groundless experience. Now this groundless experience, this is akin to the non-dual experience. So what we talk, what we say is the experience.  of awakening is actually centerless mind, groundless, open, no self-center, just flowing and somehow uncomfortable to our normal functioning. It is exactly that what we face when we really talk about the fear of going beyond at the time of leaving this body.  It is going into that groundlessness, not structured, not knowing what we wait. And actually, we are going into it every moment of our experience. The now, and I have led you a little bit into an experience of the now already, without talking too much about it, where you fear that the now, Then now, when we are not...  anticipating the future and not holding on to the past and not make the present into something. And then now, whoo, yes, it is this, groundless experience. It is this, wow, Yeah, this not being somebody solid.  In a situation that is also not solid, where everything is dynamic, opening up to this full, spacious dynamic mind, and that's exactly the practice of awareness. So you could say that it takes courage. But I also tell you it's just...  takes the same compassion that you normally put into your emotions. If you're really, if we are really compassionate with ourselves, then we look for better solutions. We look for better solutions than always structuring that reality was our dualistic thinking, with me and the other, clinging aversion.  Comparing, yes. Life can be so much easier and it will be an act of love to ourselves, of self-care, to find better solutions. So when we talk about the afflictions, you know, in the old tradition, I mean in the with a tradition they are called Mala. Mala means roof, we can trust.  That's a very heavy term for that. But actually, these are just the obstacles to awakening. The Kalesha Mother, the Skanda Mother, and so on, we can continue. But these four mothers, they're actually unskillful ways of trying to be happy. That's all. And it's just lacking the awareness.  that open, fluid, being and resonance is not dangerous. Yes. So the end of ignorance is also the end of fear. This is what you need to know. Maybe you sometimes wonder why ignorance, This lack of awareness is classified as...  emotion and why in the Abidama, when you look at the Buddhist teaching, the Abidama, you don't find fear. Although it is everywhere, everywhere, every emotion is connected to fear. And actually in this Lotus which we put out, where it says in the center, lack of awareness, ignorance, you could put fear there. because that is the taste of  knowing. All emotions that we will deal with, all these dualistic movements of mind, they have an underlying fear, an underlying fear of the unstructured nature of being, of that centralis awareness. And this is the underlying, again And there's a little bit of a...  you know, the observing capacity of our minds is, who I don't know this? What's happening there? If I let go more, will I go crazy? If I let go more, will my emotions of awareness what will happen if I let go of control? This is the, yeah, this is the underlying anxiety of fear. And this is identical  with the so-called ignorance, the center of the Mandala, you know, the center of the samsaric way of being in the world. This Lotus is a Mandala, huh? This is like a center, a center with its circumference, from the center, then all the activities of the dualistic mind, they sprout, Well, they come about.  The other Mandala, the other Lotus, which is on the Lotus Board, this is the Mandala of timeless awareness. It's the awakened Mandala. And this is from awareness, from full awareness, Dhamma Dato awareness, the realm of phenomena, from this awareness then show, not only the spacious aspect but the unhindered aspect, the equality, the very fine.  differentiating aspect and the all perfecting, the creative aspect of mind. They are all just coming naturally from that awareness. Okay, some of you were nodding as I was going along with this very subtle explanation of the emotions. Now I think it's good if you meditate a little bit. Let that  Let's sync in.  You don't have to do anything with this explanation you just received. It works and asks that what we have understood will continue to work. is no need for conceptually underlining it.  Just trust it as you breathe in, as we breathe in. And be the heart.  Maybe you notice that there is a deep acceptance of yourself, a deepening acceptance. or there is an understanding that all these various emotional states  actually adjust an expression of compassion.

    "27.mp3": " Namo Buddha, namo dama, namo sanga.  The different talks which I had since the last teaching gave me the inspiration that it might be the right time now to talk with you about what is a Mahamudra Bodhisattva. new butt.  Mahamudra you know, but it's hard for you now, but the two belong together. So, we have done so much inside exploration and I will give you a little different entry into the past by talking a little bit about the background of that tradition. One of you wrote me a little note asking can you define?  Mahamudra, what is the meaning of Mahamudra? Actually one person came here and to retreat or got interested because Mahamudra is an asana in the yogas. Yes, but it's not that. It means the same, it's the same root. Maham means great, okay? Mudra means here, normally Mudra and Tantric Buddhism means a gesture. It is a f***.  physical expression. But here, Muja is the other meaning of the word, which means a seal, a seal of authenticity, like in the old times when the kings or someone sent a letter with wax and then the seal was on the top, so that the unbroken seal arrives at the destination and shows this really comes from the person who next is here.  Now, it's the great seal. And the seal that we are talking about is that all phenomena have the seal of the empty nature. We have been already exploring the empty nature a little bit. I prefer the word ungraspable. Yes, you remember I was using this much more. So, do...  to the fact that appearances, that means whatever we live, all our experience is changing, all the time, not even standing still for any observable moment. So this constant dynamic nature of everything we experience is also its ungraspable nature. It never becomes something solid for even a moment.  doesn't have some substance to it which wouldn't change. So this is called the empty nature. And this is true for all of our experiences, for all phenomena. And that's why it's called Maha. It is Maha, Mooda, because it is the seal for the mega, Maha, Super-All phenomena here in this sense, Here in this sense because it is an all-n-com-  passing truth that is the central teaching of the Mahamudra, tradition. So when someone practices Mahamudra, then by definition we practice the direct thing of the ungraceful nature of all of our experiences. Yes, I will repeat that as some of you are writings.  So we are practicing the direct seeing of the ungraspable nature of all our experiences. And that in itself is not saying so much, right? What does that mean? From the Vipassana point of view, Mahamudra is to stay in Vipassana all the time, in meditation and an action. And here's the real repersonal, the inside.  real insight, the non-dual insight. That is what is meant. So Mahamudra, like in the announcement which you were sent when I described this, what we are going to share now, I think I call it the practice of natural being. Something like this, I usually do. Because this is the hallmark of the Mahamudra approach that this inside into the empty nature.  is not produced through an analytical reasoning or through an idea about everything being empty, but it is that which becomes obvious when you relax and you relax and you relax more and you open more completely beyond any manipulation. So completely giving up every  to manipulate one's own mind, to cling, to stress, to strive for something. This approach, completely relying on how it is, when there is no more cling, this will give the insight from within into just how it is. That's why I taught you the Six Damas of Tilupa. Remember the five nose and then the one go.  Do not reflect about the past, do not anticipate the future, do not think about the present, do not analyze, do not meditate, leave the mind naturally as it is. So, this leaves the mind natural as it is. This is actually what we are doing in Mahamudra. And this leads to an...  understanding of the dynamic nature of everything. That everything is energy, you can say. It's forces in the movement. It's fields of energy interacting. It is this interbeing in which actually we can say that everything is ungraspable, but we also say that everything has an effect. It's not just empty.  I talk to you about the fullness also, the five aspects of timeless awareness, remember? So it's not just empty in the sense of spacious and vast. It is dynamic, it is fluid, it has a taste to it. One taste is the taste of equality of the empty nature and the other taste is the vivacity, the diversity of the experience. That what makes...  life so enjoyable, which is the, you know, thanks to the differentiating quality of mind, then it is so vivid. So the Mahamudra teaching on the, or the understanding of the empty nature is one, yes, that appearances are empty, that the clear nature of mind, the luminosity is also without substance that the awareness itself is empty.  Yes, all of that is dynamic. And there is this creative side of mind. There is this dynamic side with the finely differentiating awareness. And this is what we call the timeless awareness. With all its different aspects. And you remember the teachings about the unity of compassion and wisdom. where the two really become one.  And this is thanks to the fact that our natural mind is sensitive. It feels, it has the natural capacity to perceive, to know, and to understand. And so remember there was this passage where I talked to you about that sensitivity has.  a receiving aspect where due to our connection with everything we are able to feel so much. We perceive the world with our senses, we have fine antenna for what is going on in the world around us, in our own mind and our body everywhere. this fine resonance I called it. Remember the resonance is this...  is this one aspect, but in the resonance, you know, like a drum, when you have two drums next to each other, with two sides each, you have one drum here and one drum there. You beat this drum, that drum will start vibrating. And we are like that, when something is going on around us, we vibrate. And that is the natural state of being, an awakened being, a Buddha.  Whatever you want to call it, resonates, resonates with the situation around. Resonates even, you know, with a tree, obviously, but even with one stalk of grass, we resonate even with that. We resonate with the debris of wind. We resonate with the sun and with the rain and with whoever looks, you know wherever the eyes close, whatever.  all the colors you feel the resonance. And this resonance, due to understanding the empty nature of what is being felt, here, all of this, this resonance is possible because there's no clinging. When you cling, it's like you put a hand on the drum. Then the surface of the drum cannot resonate so well. It tries to resonate, to vibrate, You're going to be a little bit more.  But the more you press, the less it resonates. And this is a good description of what happens in some Sada. We block the natural resonance because of the clinging. So we cannot feel so much. And when you have had difficult experiences, we almost do it on purpose. We don't want to feel so much because it's too much. Yeah, it's overwhelming. So what we need is when we let go of the  block it, we also need to open up the space of wisdom. It is this spaciousness that allows for the resonance to go its way and it dissolves by itself. Whatever arises as a phenomena in one's experience, whatever experience arises, it dissolves by itself. That's its dynamic nature goes into the next experience. Na.  things stays. Now when we have seen that, when we know and trust that empty nature, that ungraspable nature, where everything is self-liberating, then we can relax into that resonance. We become that living resonance and then we observe that the second part of the resonance, The creative active side is now...  not only concerned with our own happiness, but actually becomes of service to the overall situation. No matter what is there, if it's a plant that needs to be watered, a baby to be taken care of, a teaching to be given, whatever is there, there is a resonance, we feel the situation, and in the situation, if that is something disharmony.  if there is something which is grinding a little bit here, then this is very strongly failed and that is an automatic, spontaneous response of those resonating awareness to help loosening up the stress in the situation. And this is the active side of Compass. Okay, this is the...  This is actually where we allow the resonance to resonate out to make a sound. If I stay with the example of the drum, the drum will make its own sound. And in correspondence to what is failed, then the Buddha talks. The Buddha's Adva shares the Dharma, shares the debt which can help to have less...  stress in the situation. And it doesn't only mean that one is only taking care of, how do you say? It doesn't even mean one is only taking care of human beings. There's so much more to take care of. Yes, so there's stress in the environment, there's stress with invisible beings. There is everywhere one can fear, there's imbalances. So, a Buddhist mantra also in that is like  Impartial is un-pregidist. Wherever the energy goes, wherever there is a resonance felt, there will be an answer. Sometimes the answer is just a little prayer. It's like a ray of light, some rays of light going somewhere. And it's an incredible phenomenon to understand understand how a Buddhist  this is actually working, but this is not so much as a plan of what to do in this world. It's more an attitude of simply being of service. You know, since the striving for one's own benefit has ceased, yes, there's no more wanting to achieve...  something, then one can be of benefit. And let's see which situation needs it most. And this is where the energy goes. So yes, there is a structure in the activity. Yes, a body satvah has to take care of just how much energy goes where and also that there is a continuity in the activity. but basically, it is just a phenomenon.  of this resonance, which is the unity of compassion and wisdom. So, before it becomes too abstract to you, let me make it very personal. I go back in my own life. I mentioned to you that Candle D'Empagy, when I met him at the age of 22, It was in 81 that his first weekend he thought was on booty.  I think I mentioned. Yes, I did. Anyhow, that resonated with me so strongly that at that time I thought, wow, this guy already felt his quite old, he wasn't so old, but he had come from Tibet all the way and he was teaching one only weekend in Freiburg in Germany. Does the only time we came to Firework and there happened to be there?  We were only 40 people. And for the first time in my life, I felt this person is walking the talk. You know, walk the talk. This means like completely authentic. The every word that this person says is lift 100%. And at that moment I regained my trust in humanity.  So far I had encountered so many solar-la spiritual people, you know. Solar-la means not quite. Yeah. Talking nicely, Kaha, kaha. Yes. Yes, something like that. Sounds good. I mean, it doesn't sound so good, no. So, so far, you know, I've been upbringing in this...  Christian family and so on and actually the talk and the work were different. The acts and the talk where there was too much discrepancy and I had been longing for some authentic example. That encounter, that one encounter changed my life. And that is what I meant when I explained.  that the Buddha said, well, works like a catalyst. Remember that? Caterlist means just being there and allowing for interaction, not really doing something, just being authentic, being there. And that inspired me so much, then came the face of practicing Vipassana and so on. and um where?  Here, at that time I had one girlfriend who brought me to Gennaro Rinpoche at that time, but then I had another one. I spare you the story. Women were always very instructive on my path. And then I got engaged with my later on wife, Irin. and she brought me to make the study.  show to Carlo Rampagli. Carlo Rampagli became then our first root guru, so to speak, we regarded him as our main teacher. And Carlo Rampagli came to a small village in northern Italy, which my wife, Adena and myself were taking care of. I was the homeopath in that village every month. I wanted to treat the people.  And she had co-founded this Buddhist village, and we had built up the ruins, like there was only rocks left, and we made the houses again and so on. And Kalurin put it as old, frail, monk, who very powerful, present, very clear. He couldn't walk anymore at that time. So we fabricated this kind of Samfter we say in German. This is like two people in front.  to Pilipiul in the back and each one, Alunka. And we carried him up, we carried him up the mountain. Because it was on the mountain, there was no road to this village. So we carried him up there and he gave the bodhisattva vow. He gave the former promise to become a bodhisattva. And I had had a little...  bit of time to contemplate that I knew what was the meaning. It was very dear to my heart. It was still at that time a medical student, I was maybe in my fifth year or something. And wow, I remember that how I contemplated he gave one teaching the first day and then announced for the second day you would give that wow and I contemplated.  I took the vow. Yes? And I knew, and this is why I tell the whole story, because that's the essence of the vow. I knew from that day on that my life does not belong to me anymore. You look at me like I'm a track passing by or something. This is the message. You give up your free  freedom of self-decision and you are a servant to the true needs of those who you meet. So you don't serve the neurotic needs, it's not serving the desires of people and following their fears, but you serve their Buddha nature. And that moment, this is, I really got the meaning of the Bodhisattva-va. that moment.  I understood that this attitude of becoming a servant, that my life doesn't belong to me, that this will really change my life. Yes, obviously. And I understood there was an idea, there was a complete joy in doing that, but also the voice.  fear. There was a fear because, wow, and I didn't have the understanding of the empty nature at that time. I thought, wow, that's very inspiring, but that's the most inspiring I can feel in the world to be truly of service and to find one's freedom in the service. Maybe some of you in the experience  of being parents, maybe you have lived that, that being of service to your children, or maybe being of service to your parents or to someone else, that this is an expression of freedom. And so you will not understand the Mahmoudra tradition if I don't explain to you that it is embedded added in this body satwa attitude.  It is actually not quite thinkable to practice Mahamudra outside the Bodhisattva path. Because what does it mean with then with Mahamudra and this whole combination because I'm going to talk a little bit about that now? Of course, it's an expression of compassion and love for centen beings. Of course. Here's...  But this expression of love and compassion is not stupid. It is not that someone thinks or believes that I can rescue the world, that I can change some sardar and that I can bring beings to enlightenment. You know, if anyone had been capable of that, then the Buddhas of the past would already have done that. This is not possible. You cannot bring.  beings to enlightenment. What you can do by compassion and love is to go the path as good as you can and then become an inspiring example. For others to follow as well. You become a catalyst, right? This is a new word, but it's meaning the same thing. You become an inspiring example. Everyone in his  her own way. So nobody is sad for, or nobody is sad for, is the same as another, as another. You will be not imitating each other in the way we are, but the motivation is the same. The motivation is to go into awakening and to let this awakening be of benefit to all, without limits. So you're all very, very familiar  I hope with the four Brahma-Vihadas, right? The four limitless qualities, the immeasurable. Now if you let this love and compassion become limitless, not only a number for all sentient beings, but also limitless in time, then it means for all times. You don't put a limit, you don't say only for this life, then I take a...  You know, love and compassion for all times, for all beings, no limits. And I have no idea what that means for all times and all beings. I just know it's big. There is bigger than what I can take. And then you combine that with the joy. You combine that with the joy. This is the joy in practicing and shedding.  the wholesome. This is a special joy. So Medita does not only mean to be joyful with the wonderful wholesome acts of others, it is rejoicing in all the wholesome that is in the world. Whatever is beneficial, you rejoice with. Personal others, you know, it is that joy which makes you enter into all the samadis, it is that joy which gives the energy.  to share the Dharma, it is that joy which makes you water the flowers. It's always, you know, it's that joy. Again, you understand? It's the joy of service. You get it? It's the joy of serving the world. It's a joy of generously sharing with the world whatever wholesome that is. This is Medita. So this is my detail.  with the love, with the Ma'echi, Meta and Karuna, this needs the very important equanimity. And this equanimity, you have heard about it in my teaching about the equality of all phenomena. The true equanimity is not something you practice. It is due to seeing the nature of all phenomena to be ungraspable.  And then there is no attachment and aversion. So it's the wisdom side. I think you must have heard that in the teachings. So it's not new. So it is this equanimity which comes from truly seeing the ungraspable empty nature, the selfless nature of all phenomena, that gives the service to all sentient beings its actual dimension of you  Nobody serving anyone. You see, there is not a clinging to the Self of the Buddha, Sattva. There is no one doing it. And yet, this body and mind are always in the service of everybody. But so natural that you don't even notice that you are serving. There is no concept that I need to serve. This concept that I  to serve is a preliminary. This is called the relative bodhicitta. It is the preparation, it is how we enter that practice by making this wishes repeatedly and so on. Until some realization arises and then it just becomes normal. You don't have to tell yourself to do like this all the time because that's actually the natural state of mind.  The mind is naturally in service of the overall situation, of all beings and all trees and whatever. Yes, it's naturally like that. It wouldn't occur to a mind without clinging to a self to be different. It doesn't occur. The idea is just don't arise. Because it's not important to take care of yet another happiness of oneself and another privilege, another...  something, you know, doesn't make sense because one has already discovered the wishful feeling jewel of one's own mind and there's nowhere to go. So naturally this is being shared. So this bodhicitta, you have thought this word now many times, this bodhicitta which is a little bit with effort which is called the Baudi Chitter of Speration and then which involves  the effort to apply oneself to the parameters, generosity, Sheila, wholesome conduct, patience, joyful perseverance, you know, this energy to do the house. This kind of effort and also the effort and meditation, this is only preliminary. This is because our mind is still a little bit in clinging And then we make an effort to cling.  less. Yes, you know, you get it, but it's not much of an effort. It's more like releasing all the breaks, all that which stops the process, which stops the natural mind from manifesting its quality. So the effort is as much as the effort of opening this fist. You know, actually, if you're honest, I'm making an F.  to close the fist. Now, but since I'm so used to grasping, then it feels like this is the normal state. And then the dharma teachings, they are like, how about starting with the thumb, you know? Like, you could, how to relax, you don't know? Well, lift the thumb a little bit, okay, lifting it. Then let it, come on, let it relax a little bit. And now, okay, now stay like  And now, don't go back. Say, you do the same with the index. Come on, come on there. You know, it's not so dangerous. You can let go a little bit more of control. Yeah, yeah, yeah, come. You see, it's not so bad. Yeah, it's good. Now stay, stay. Yeah, okay, okay, okay. Like this, all the Dharma teachings there about but relaxing, relaxing.  this hand, relaxing the grasping, how much effort is involved in that? It's incredible, but you must admit actually is no effort because we are just undoing a very unskillful way of dealing with reality, constantly grasping and then we are told, we use so many techniques like developing, developing devotion to this for your jouers, developing...  loving love, loving kindness and compassion. We are contemplating impermanence and all of that just to relax the clinging to something which seems permanent. We meditate hours after hours and we think of so much effort. Actually it is just getting us out of all this distracting activity that is so exhausting. getting us out of some sada a little bit, little pause.  And we call it, we call it effort of meditation. But from the beginning, Dharma is actually about doing less effort. To stop the wrong kind of effort and to go into the direction of something which is more wholesome. And it's all about this relaxation, yeah? Relaxed mind, open mind, fluid mind, spacious. Warm, you know, not so self-concent. You know, all of what we have been talking of.  So the Bodhisattva path knows that. And the Bodhisattva masters who give the vows, they know exactly where, that no one is ever going to rescue anybody. There is no idea like that. It's just the way of talking that we are here to help everybody attain awakening, which we...  will do, but in a nobody's way. It is not by personal effort. Otherwise, as you know, with psychology, when you try to do something with personal effort, where do you finish? Burn out. Right? It's programmed. You want to help all the students in your school, all the students everywhere. You run here, you run there, you burn out, programmed. a doctor in hospital wanting to save  all the patients fighting against death, fighting against some Sardar, were not programmed. So, what is Sardar activity is absolutely dependent on this insight in the empty nature of phenomena that actually the Sardar that we liberate beings from, so to speak, is empty nature. It doesn't exist as Sun.  These are forces creating some sadic suffering, creating dukkha all the time, but not extraneous forces, outside of ourselves. It's our own mind creating this tension all the time. So what we need to do is we need to show ways how to relax the fister, how to to relax the grasping. And this is all of what we show.  is like how to be open, how to be in resonance, how to relax, how to reduce the unnecessary effort and to put in the effort, there where it's needed. And from this morning's teaching and yesterday, remember the effort is that with the right motivation we direct our awareness. So the satsih is being...  directed by say bodhicitta, say compassion, is directed there where it is most helpful. And then, because the light of awareness goes into those areas, then things open. This is the only effort we are doing. The only effort is to cultivate, to go with that motivation, which is most...  and resonance with the word, called love, called compassion. We direct the attention where it seems to be most helpful, for that we need a little understanding. We need some study. We need to hear a few teachings. We need the regidance to know where to direct our attention. And then we do it. And as we do it, we understand a little bit more. And that is already related.  This understanding produces any effect. When we understand the word more, we are a little bit less lost. We understand the working of the emotions. We know how to relax them and we are a little bit more free. We look for the Self, the so-called Self. When it's not a clear realization, but already we feel I can't really find something so clear. Something something  there, something which I could call a soul or the core of my being. It's all very open and dynamic in there. Nothing solid to be found. So it already relaxes our clinging to the Self. And that's the path of the Bodhisattva. The path of the Bodhisattva is inseparable from understanding the empty nature of all phenomena, Mahamudra. Peace.  Even if it is called Zogchen or if it's called Mathiamika, there are different names for that. Yes, but the understanding of the true nature of all phenomena is a must. It's a must for the body satva. Otherwise, a body satva, a body satva, we get completely exhausted. Without that understanding, oh, you just have to look around and maybe look in your own biography, You're up.  probably trying to help the world and you were getting very tired and you may have lost your joy. You may have lost the inspiration and you didn't know where to find it again. And for that, a Mahamudra Buddhist Adva, which is saying almost the same thing, then it needs to have a direct contact with Vadek Vhv.  call the Source. There was one teaching where I talked to you about touching into the Source. A daily touchdown. This is the daily connection with that dimension of being whether there's nothing to be achieved. Nothing to be achieved means also nowhere to go, nobody going anywhere. It means that if I meet with suffering, the only thing to...  to do is to dissolve the illusion which leads to the grasping that leads to the suffering. I need to dissolve the lack of awareness that leads to the grasping. The rest will follow by itself. So the whole task of a body-sutwa is to generate that field of awareness. Okay, you follow? It's a generate.  that field of awareness, which is stimulating to the awareness of others, so that they can tune in and they also find into that understanding. Oh, is Shakyana. We have an agreement. Oh, I don't tell. And so...  So this fear of awareness is so helpful, it is so helpful because it is non-manuprelative. A body sat was way of action, as always, without manipulation. It's just an invitation. It's an invitation, as we say in the language of Tantric Buddhism, it's an invitation to enter the pure land. the pure land of a body.  Bodhi satvah of a buddhi or Buddha, is the invitation, hey, join in. Let your mind open to the same awareness that is the awareness of awakening. And this is what the Buddha did, 45 years of his life, he invited beings into his awareness. And he thought, everybody, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it. there was never anything else he said.  You are like me, you can understand, you can become free. And seemingly his field of awareness was so strong, that thousands and thousands became unheard in his times. And the Bodhisattva tradition claims and so many became Bodhisattvaism and Bodhisattvaism in his time. And this is what is the activity of a Bodhisattva. And since this understanding of the Mt  nature of all phenomena, includes also the experience of death, of the so-called death, which is leaving this body, leaving this dynamic home beyond and flowing on in the stream of experience, then the buddhisattva vow naturally and clothes, all of the fluidity experiences that are still to come.  So we don't know when the Bodhisattva will dissolve into simply, you know, spacious awareness, but for as long as there is a manifestation, why not? We will definitely continue with sharing this awareness with everyone, every situation that this mind-stream encounters. it wouldn't be logic to say this is a  only for this life. No, it is for the continuity of this developing stream of awareness. So for as long as that might be possible, as that might take, may everyone benefit from it, may everyone drink, drink and eat from the nectar of timeless awareness, may everyone benefit from this.  Being, you know, and then this comes, then you come to search for your Lations, like in the practice of Truth, where we say, yes, come all beings, eat me up, eat up this body, it becomes a nectar of timeless awareness, a nectar ocean of Jnana, which is the word for timeless awareness. So, vidia, vidia in the end sans credis.  This is the same meaning. So this understanding, which is the unity of compassion and wisdom, this is actually the food for all sentient beings. And the wonder for discovery, I can talk a little bit about that for my life since then, since the age of 25, when I took the body, I said wow, I think it's 20.  maybe twenty-six. Since that I have never regretted. It has only been a joy. Only. From joy to joy to more joy to more joy, more will excite, more openness. Less and less fear. And really it makes so much sense. And maybe from this now Now after I've prepared you for a few days and now I think talk about the...  Inside aspect of the practice, the Mahmoudah side, and now talking to you about the bodhisattva side, now perhaps you can feel how the two fit together. Yes, you can feel that. So these great beings like Nagarjuna, which have this bodhisattva, okay? Santi Deva, or you know, I don't know whom you know, but there's many of them. and uh  I have met in Brahma when I visited there. I have met Bodhisattvas in the Tera-Vada tradition. You should know that this also exists, and they are not limited to only this life, their Bodhisattva has been. I have met practitioners in all traditions who are inspired by this to unite the deep understanding of  nature, with the practice of compassion. This is the unity of wisdom and compassion. And they are doing it in a limitless way. And they always say there is no higher refuge than the four immeasurable, the four Brahma vihadas. But the four Brahma vihadas are understood like this. Yeah, this is what I was giving now is of course, a teaching about Mahamudra with a body sub.  but it was at the same time just the teaching about the four Brahma-vihadas. Yes, this is the real refuge. Okay, this much for now, it was a lot, huh? It was a lot. But now I have allowed you to look deeply into my heart. This is where the energy comes from. Yes, this is the real inspiration, because they have met people who lived there.  And I feel, wow, that's really inspiring. That's really the way to go and you start a small bodhisattva and then the users continue. Wow, it's possible. It's possible. It sounds like when I heard it first, it was like up there somewhere. you know, like I got but so inspiring.  but so far away. And then it became so close, it became my life and it's easy, it's not difficult. It would be difficult to live something else, honestly. To return to normal life would be difficult, to return to a life of self-serving attitudes, would be very painful. Since I think of it now, one person  wrote me a little note in order to follow this path, do I need to become a monk or what is the condition of, you know, lay practice and so on. So I want to answer that quickly. The Bodhisattva tradition is especially meant for the lay people. It is very much fitting to also live that in a lay context because  all relationships are included. And especially the partner relationship, and nowadays, where we don't necessarily have children, we can avoid to have children, then the partner relationship is a wonderful learning ground for the body satva or body satva. It is where we, as you know, partners, they know all our buttons. They press here and you go, they press there and you go different. You know, it's like...  So others, they don't press, they don't come so close, they are very respectful. But the partner does it. So it's a perfect learning grant, and especially, of course, if both are on the path, it's very, very helpful. I have to admit that  It is best to really devote one's whole life to the Dharma. So if behind this question is of becoming a monk or not, is the question whether it means devoting one's whole life to the Dharma or not, I have to admit. Yes, I know people practicing in families and being married to a partner who's not practicing the Dharma and having done their profession. and they have done wonderful lives and growing  in the understanding and being beautiful, inspiring examples of Dharma practice. However, they all regret if they have not been able to do it full-time, they regret this that they couldn't at an early stage in life give themselves full-time to the study, contemplation, meditation, because always they needed to integrate so many practical aspects of the life and taking care.  of children is a big thing. And although you can make it a practice, then in your capacity to explain the Dharma, this lack of study, the lack of long years of retreat practice, and so on, this shows. It makes a difference. So if that person who wrote that question wanted to know about that then  Go for it. If you fear the time has come in your life, go for full Dharma practice and include the study as well. Don't neglect the study and remember, we were contemplating a lot. So in between the study and the meditation, there is the contemplation. So do all three practices and then you come to a very integrated understanding and this will help a lot. I'm sorry.  but you don't necessarily have to become a monk. By myself, I was a monk for 21 years, but 10 of these years were very, very happy. And then I felt, for the 11 years, I felt that my wish to share an intimate relationship was there in the background. It had come back again. So to my own surprise, because I felt so free of that, but it came back again. and forged netlators very easy.  our tradition to give back the vows and to join the lay life because above all we are bodhisattvas and which form of lifestyle you choose depends on your life situation and but one thing you never abandon is to bodhisattva vow whether you practice it in lay life or a monastic life doesn't really matter. It's a little different approach in the...  the Tibetan tradition like this. Same as in Zen. Zen monks are also Buddhist Sattva monks. They are not monastic monks with celibacy, because there was one Japanese emperor who didn't want the monastic Sangre in Japan to be so strong, so he obliged them to marry. all they gave back them on asking vowels, they got  to relationships and they continued as Zen monks but with family. That's the origin of this strange thing with the Zen monk who is not celibate. The Bodhisattva vow dominates over everything. The monk's ceremony of Zen is a Bodhisattva vow ceremony. And the monastic aspect was not practiced in Japan from that.  I'm on not very much at least. Okay. End of the talk. Thank you for being there and for making this talk come out. How about if we sing a mantra together? Yes? Oh. Lila, take your microphone or take mine. You lead the channel.  Oh, come on. Okay, we do it together.

Connected with the body and breathing, there's a constant flow of feeling, sensations coming from the body.  We can even smell. And there is this minding process, being aware of thoughts, moods, little fluctuations in awareness.  This is the vivid nature of mind. We call these experiences appearances, that...  which appears in consciousness, that which appears in mind.  If we were to stop here, we would have to stop here. If we were to stop here.  Here it would be vivid but somehow passive. And this would not do justice to how the mind is. There is a creative interaction. Appearances are not just appearances. Maybe more proper to call them the creative.  play of mind. Some of it is karma. It's the effect of what we have lived so far. after effect of past creations.

I'm going to go to the next slide.  In the next section, we will invite you to work a little bit with an emotion, but please take a simple one and easy one. the toughest not the roughest just a little one.  Something which you will be able to allow to come to your mind. A little disliking, a little liking, something like this. What we are going to do is we will combine the breathing. Thank you.  with the Self-Liberation. And I will show you how to do it. And just be so wise to maybe take something which a little emotion here from the retreat, something of the last days. I suspect you might have had some emotions. It can happen in even an retreat.  a little clinging, a little version, something of that kind. So the basic practice will be that every time we remember it, We will learn to immediately let it go again.  That's the basic practice. Touch and go. The practice is be aware and let it flow.  Let's start with establishing our self, and the practice of breathing in and breathing out with awareness. Set your mindfulness right on the experience of breathing.  Following the in-breath from its very beginning, through the middle, for the matter  to the end, the turning point, breathing out, beginning, middle end. Turning point and so on, very closely. Feeling this natural movement.  Feeling it fully.  I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide.

Allow it to become a whole body breathing. we take the heart.  The centre of the chest is the centre from which the breathing happens. The whole body breathing into the heart, and breathing out from the heart.  Now imagine that the hard area, the center of the chest, best.  becomes a very wide sphere, very vast, luminous, like a luminous space opening up in the center of your being. that you better do this.  and sometimes they put a Buddha there to make it even easier to fear what this luminous sphere is about. We can call it today, this is the sphere, the Palace of Self-Liberation.  Whatever we feel on the in-breath, these feelings enter that creates fear of light and dissolve in that. A little bit like clouds entering the warm open sky and then  this already. We do a few in.  with just that whatever comes to mind, breathing it into this vast space of awareness. Where it can dissolve.  And breathing out we end this simplicity after the self-liberation. So wonderful that everything liberates by itself.  I'm going to go to the next slide.

With the Inbred we open up to experiences, breathing them so to speak and to their heart. you  This is the sphere of self-lovelation. with the outbreath we are in this warm, compassionate, freedom that flows.  It flows everywhere our attention is going to.  So we start with ourselves. Some little situation, perhaps of the past days, where we had a little emotion. Something that we can call to mind that comes to mind almost spontaneously. Okay, please add in.  and we allow it to liberate. And that's the moment already of letting go. Feeling it, remembering it, and normal identification.  And shift to the Outware, offering yourself that freedom, that relaxation, that comes from being aware and then opening up to the floor again, that comes from the same  There are no processes of deeply accepting ourselves. of deeply accepting ourselves.  take the embers as a symbol to be in the world, to feel our emotion. And the heart is the symbol of knowing its true nature. And the output is  symbol of that warm understanding that flows back into the world of our experiences.  Imagine yourself how you were in this moment of attachment or the version. And with the warm heart breathe in. And breathe out again and give yourself all the love and support that you would have needed in that moment. Give yourself an retrace back.  that understanding that you would have needed then.  Breathing in, we feel the stress that was connected to this emotional experience. Distress deserves to gather the wisdom memory of the situation, with the emotional. This works and that opens.  And the warm understanding flows back.  And now towards the end of this exercise stay more with the outburst with the symbol of medishing yourself.

Just some things change slower than others, because the conditions are a little bit more stable.  you  Seeing the nature of change everywhere, this is called the equality of all phenomena, the sameness, they are same in the nature of change, the dynamic nature. seeing that they are all different, that none of them is...  same in appearance. This is yet another quality of mind. Also part of life. Vivid, fresh, never the same. This is also important to see. The unique experience of now.  you  It is unique because everything changes. you  you  you  you  This is thanks to the clarity of our mind that we can see all these fine developments, find changes, the fine colors, tastes and so on of our experience.  Very clearly noticing every in-breath, every out-breath.  And this capacity to know and to differentiate is sometimes likened to the Sun. So  If the mind were luminous and the element corresponding to it is fire, which makes which Brightens up the darkness of the night. And this sun brightens up the day.  This is the luminous nature of mind. The capacity to see.  breathing in and out in this way we contemplate the nature of being.  you  you  I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one.

And you might be waiting that I mentioned the last aspect, the fifth one. you  This is the creative aspect of that very same mind. This mind which is open, fluid, reliable in its changing nature, luminous in its knowing capacity and that is also creative.  It actually has the power to create change. simply directing our attention somewhere else and changes there.  Turning our attention to, for example, warmly breathing in, a kind breathing in and kind breathing hot and our experience changes.  you  Wherever we direct our attention, this makes that a different wind is blowing in our experience. you  It can be an nourishing wind that brings the necessary rain to water the gardens Thanks.  the fields, which is a metaphor for saying, watering the mind of other sentient beings. It's called nurturing the Buddha Fields, because every sentient being is seen to be a potential Buddha Field.  The waters of compassion are being brought by the wind of love, by the energy of wisdom. And like that every breath which goes out can be a breath of love going into all directions, a thought of love.  Kindly breathing in and breathing out.  you  I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing.

Maybe you would like to take that practice home with you. We can call it breathing with the five elements. It will enrich your Pisanal practice where you are already using breathing as a daily support.  And the way to do it is you start first and the use will weigh. As you always start, the take where future. Maybe you do the four contemplations that we did before, the precious human life, impermanence, karma, the disadvantages of some Sada. you do that to take refuge.  again. And then you develop the aspiration to practice for the benefit of all the whole planet, whatever, the whole, everything that comes to your mind actually, there's nothing big, anyhow we practice with what comes to our mind, this is our world. So we practice for the whole world. And we breathe with that. And yes, we go.  through the four sati-patanas, you know, we go through the body, take good care of ourselves, and we breathe for our emotions, the mental formations. We breathe with the deeper layers of our mind, and then we turn to this practice of seeing the nature of experience.  And you can do it in this order, like I did first, the spacious nature, then the fluidity, then the reliable nature, then the luminous nature, and then the creative one. You know, this is very helpful at times, not maybe every day, but at times to go through, that gives you a beautiful...  All and composing understanding of how we create our world and how we can become free.",
    "15.mp3": " Namodama, namodama, namosanga.  The main point of Buddhist meditation is to develop insight, a liberating insight. you  Mentor calm is helpful for that. Not absolutely necessary, but it is difficult to develop inside without Mentor calm. However, to calm the mind and to enter the dhyanas is not liberating in itself. It is just a nice break. So we need to understand.  What's going on? We need to understand. What we experience, how life is? A liberating understanding, liberating us from that grasping which creates Dukar. We are not talking about liberation from the conditions of this world. Also a Buddha, when he or she works, then when  walking into a thong, there will be pain, right? But there will be no drama around the pain. And whenever an awakened person comes to a hot country, will also sweat, right? We feel it's hot, right? But there's no drama. Okay, this is this no drama is the  end of Dukadukata, here is the end of the suffering upon suffering. But the unplays not the challenging conditions of this world, they will not change with Lebanis, but the drama will stop. And the drama stops because we look through the experiences. see that in that what we cling to because we think it's agreeable.  There's nothing to hold onto. And that would be fight. There is no substance whatsoever. We are fighting mirage. We are fighting projections. All of that is so because of the nature of change, the dynamic nature of appearances. So, an awakened person.  See through that changing nature. And see through also the whole process of perception, you know, who we are ourselves. This is the third kind of, to kind of, that kind of suffering. Just you took a clinging to this what we call this kandars. It's just aggregates. I briefly remind you how the teaching about these aggregates came about to the Buddha.  were sitting in a forest. And some woodcutters had cut locks. They had stored the locks inside of the Buddha. And at that time, when sitting there, the Buddha was asked by a person, how about the Self? Is there an Atman? Is there a Self? The Buddha said, where you cannot really say there is no Self or there is a Self, it's more like with those locks over there. and the  or Skanda means heap. It's supposed to be this heap, like with this heap over there. It's made up of locks, you know, and actually our, the way we function is also made up of aggregates. Basically there are these five aggregates of perceiving forms, of having sensations, feeling stones, feeling tones, and connection with what we perceive to distinguish them, to be able to name them distinctly.  to introduce them from each other, then to have all kinds of mental reactions connected to that, some of them wholesome, some of them unwholesome, and this produces lots of different states of consciousness. Now with each of these different aspects of being, you can identify, you can think it's solid, but none of this is actually a me, a self. It's like with those logs. You know, if you put 5 logs, you have a heap of f***  But each of these logs you can peel it apart. You know, it's made out of, you know, sales actually. It's made out of wooden, how to say, fibers, fibers. So, like this, when you look into the functioning of any sentient being, you find it's made up of many forces. many you can say many  ways of functioning forces which interact, which lead to a perception and then to the next one, and lead to sensations that means, to feelings about that, lead to reactions. And all of this, all of this seems to be so real, but basically, take those logs over there, you know, it's just heaps of different forces and they all change. these locks they will not be there.  in a hundred years, you know, they will all, even if we do nothing about them, they will all disintegrate. If we put a fire, it's quicker. And that's the Buddha's answer to this canvas. And this is our basic identification we think because we are sitting here with a form, because we perceive, Because we think about what we perceive and because we have emotions.  then different states of experience, of consciousness, we think we exist. This is very normal, yes, it's very normal, but it's just changing phenomena actually, coming together for some time and changing as we go along. Yes, always. So this Timon, which I was, if I showed you a photo of how I was when I was born, I'll be.  You wouldn't know who this guy is, although he's sitting in front of you and thinks he is still this one, but he's not changing all the time, it's the same for you. We're changing, but we are not changing completely. Because the conditions are such that from yesterday to today we haven't changed so much, we can recognize each other. There's a continuity of forces which  makes that for as long as we are in this body, the changes are gradual, so that we usually recognize each other the next morning, usually. We might not recognize each other after 30 or 40 years, like the people I went to school with, I'm not sure I would recognize them on the street. We've turned to a lot.  And we come together, we have to introduce ourselves. Remember, I am this guy, you beat me on the head, you know? So change, when we see the change in nature, it doesn't mean that we are ignorant of the stability. There is a stability for as much as conditions don't change so quickly, right? you  When conditions remain quite stable, there is a sufficient continuity for this wall and even the curtain in front of it, a sufficient stability to probably be there if there is no fire and nothing else still next year. But it will have changed in a subtle way. And at some point you have to change the curtains, you know, because the change is just...  too much, or they will fall down by themselves. So this is a nice way of looking at life. It's a way of knowing change, and then the understanding that we are going for the inside in meditation is not only about the fact of change, but it is about the forces that create the change. We also want to understand life.  We want to know what makes our world, what makes our world be the way it is. And there we come into touch with the creative power of mind. That we are each sitting here, seemingly in the same hall. But we all sit in a different hall. We all sit in a different experience right now. experience and your neighbors experience.  is in my experience, although we are so close to each other, it's not the same. I don't really know what you are feeling. We have an overlapping sensory input. We have something which is similar, but then each one is having a different body already, each one had a different night, a different sleep and so on. We have a different upbringing, we have different preferences. Wow, and with all of that here.  the womb, we have just as many different worlds here in this room as there are people in this room. And if we have an aunt crawling around, it will have a very different experience from us. So this we also need to look through, not only that there is nothing permanent they saw that we also need to look through the forces which create our perception of the world.  So we look into cause and effect. If I look with this attitude, with this motivation, I see that. Partnerships are beautiful examples. When you fall in love, you have a certain way of looking. At the moment of divorce, you have a different moment of looking. It's like, it hasn't changed so much. It can only be a few years in between. Where the different way of perceiving the room.  Very different. Or to put it yet another way. Two people come for retreat and they're being shown the retreat rooms. Everything there what you need there is a bed. There is a chair. There's a cupboard and a window. One person who works and I said, oof, this looks like a prison cell to me. And the next person comes and says, Oh.  Wow, wow, this is going to be my temple of liberation. You know, like completely different perspective, same rule. And like this we go through the world and we believe in our world, we believe strongly in it. We react to our ways of seeing the world. meditation means to see through all of that. To see...  through the workings of our mind, how it creates the seeming identity, how it creates words which we tend to think so real, even with the ones closest to us. Sometimes the words seem to be so far apart, we can't communicate, we don't understand each other. It's like different words, although we love each other so much. and we need to see through all of that. And we see condition.  The Buddha talked a lot about conditioning, causes and conditions which create the different words. And basically, that's mind, or we need to understand mind. Now, whenever there is an understanding of that kind, there is a greater sense of feeling at ease with the word. the word. Because if I understand how the word  functions, I'm more at ease with it. I can do something about it. If I feel my way of looking at the world is not so helpful, I can put my attention a little bit in a different direction. I can steer my interest to go a little bit differently. Like from time to time, like we are doing here regularly encourage thoughts like even the person I don't like.  is my brother or my sister. In a way, this person is also searching for happiness. Just like me, there is something which we have in common. These thoughts already change the perspective so much. So we use them. We use them to go towards a more open worldview. So much of that, what we are doing in meditation is to steer our interest in  areas which are helpful. And it is very helpful that to find out in meditation that there is a completely relaxed way of being in the world where we don't create a, we don't enter a version to what is disagreeable. We don't enter clinging to what is agreeable and we don't identify with the process is going on.  ourselves. Yeah. So these are the three kinds of something. We find out that it is so easy actually. It needs everywhere looking through. I need to look through that what is, what I'm so averse to, what creates so much anger and aversion. What's the nature of that? Is really worthwhile fighting with it.  will that make it worse? Or maybe do I have to just wait for the change? Or maybe I can enhance a positive change, I can go for a positive change using the creativity of mind instead of solidifying the problem. Same for the wonderful things that we encounter. Have you ever found that clinging to a wonderful situation has made it last any long.  No. The moment we start clinging, actually we are already not so open anymore. The best way to make it last longer is to stay relaxed. To continue with the same conditions of openness and of benevolence and so on, that gave rise to this wonderful situation. So with  take care rather of the conditions that give rise to something agreeable, then clinging to the result. The result is only a result. And one of the most important conditions of joy is gone when we cling, because then we have fear to lose something. So already the joy is getting less when there is fear to lose something agreeable. So rather go back to the appreciation of that which is there.  knowing that it is conditioned, knowing that it is changing, and that needs support, it needs our openness, it needs our love, it needs our care, like a good relationship, needs daily care, needs daily care to be able to continue in this good way. So here again, we see that there's nothing to be grasped at, we cannot prolong a situation by grasping at it. Samt  Sometimes when I'm in the mood, I ask the whole audience, now, let's grasp at this moment of now, it's so nice. Let's all grasp together and try that it doesn't change. What work is obvious. It's so obvious, it's so clear. Now a amount of grasping can stop its situation from changing. But we can...  and courage, similar situations to arise again and again. Like if I encounter the person that elects so much yesterday, if I encounter it today, with a similar interest and a similar openness and appreciation, then the chances are that it is going again into a very nice way of being together. It also depends on other factors. Here, the other person, the factors around.  something could have happened, which doesn't make it possible. We don't have all the factors in our hand. We only have our own mind. So meditation is much about how to use one's own mind. And to look again and again, this is now I can once more to the third kind of suffering. To look again and again, if that is truly someone meditating, and if there's truly  someone seeing or someone feeling the pain, feeling the discomfort, always looking inside, always looking within. I can't even find someone talking. Can you find someone listening? Have a look. Maybe I should talk that you...  can check whether you are listening. Can you find the one searching? So this is inside meditation. You understand? All of what I'm talking now is different ways of developing inside meditation. The inside, not only meditation. Inside is developed in three ways. It is developed through hearing. like some of you have  maybe hopefully gained a little bit deeper insight just by listening. It's the first way listening and studying, reading. This is the first way to develop some understanding, by taking in the instructions of the transmission of wisdom. But then comes the more important thing, and you're doing it constantly while you're listening, You are doing it because...  contemplation. Actually you compared it with your own personal experience. For example, one person was shaking the head when I said, you can't prolong a situation when grasping. That person was obviously thinking that you can prolong the situation when grasping. So there was a checking with one's own experience. And to invite you to check all the Dharma, you have to test it.  And this testing, this is contemplation. You test that you compare, you look, you see whether it concords with what you have experienced so far. And this contemplation continues also when we sit on the question. When we sit on the question, actually part of the time we spend there is not properly called meditation, but it is contemplating our life. It is contemplating our experience. when I  I ask you, any body teacher, I suggest to you look at the impermanent nature of what is experienced. That is contemplation. You are using your intellect. You are using the capacity to understand of the intellectuals. Oh yeah, between what was before and now there's a definite change. Oh yes!  This breathing in and the last breathing in, there are different in a subtle way. This is still contemplation, we are not meditating it. Okay? We are comparing actually one breast to another. We are comparing our experience with the words of the teaching. We are checking and this is good. This is the second way of developing understanding. it is to compare everything.  that is set with our personal experience. And then comes the point of meditation. The meditation usually starts when we have the feeling, yes. Ah, that's how it is. And then after that, ah, there is a non-conceptor stretch where we are not comparing anymore.  We are directly experiencing in a non-conceptor way just how it is. And this is what I taught you yesterday as the pause. Right? It is the pause after the observation. We often say we are meditating with breathing. Actually, we are mostly contemplating breathing. We are, there is a thinking process going along with the breathing experiences and there Is it labeling there?  there is so much intellect still there. So the actual meditation starts when we don't need to do that anymore. When there is no more labeling, no more comments, no more. But just this. them in this undescribable.  This is the real meditation. This is where the real insight comes from. That is the third form of developing understanding. It's a non-conceptual way of developing understanding. And that's the real meditation. And the three, they work together, the ones who are listening and studying, the ones who are comparing, contemplating and the one through.  Non-conceptual being. Non-conceptual being doesn't mean that it is non-dual being. Oh no, no. It's not necessarily non-dual being. There's a lot of understanding, arising from silent meditation without labeling, but still there is a slight observing quality there. Also, this gives rise to deeper understanding. and then that liberating inside.  That we talk about, that comes from letting go not only into the non-conceptual dimension, but into that dimension where not even this observing activity of the mind is going on. Free from that observing activity, that is at the same time being free from a subject. The subject always observes, that's what we call subject. Let's see, observe.  the unnecessary observing activity of the mind. When that relaxes, then we are in that experience from which the deepest intuitive inside arises. And I yesterday evening and this morning, I gave you some of course conceptual explanations about aspects of this.  non-conceptual and also non-dual experience of life. So I was talking actually about the mind of awakening. And although all of that is conceptual, these are explanations. Then we can use it as a help to feel our way in, to how how we actually are what are the what are the  And the basic functions of mind, even when free of the clinging to self and other, the subject and object. And we did it this morning, a little bit. I walked you through the five patterns of the Lotus. I mean, the central and the four patterns, yes. We went through and just a little bit connecting it with our breathing.  And why it is helpful is because it brings us close to how it actually is, also for awakened beings, in the awakened experience. That's helpful. And you will learn to trust your own mind, which is very important to be able to let go. Trusting your own mother.  that nothing will go wrong. You will not lose these very important capacities that make up life. So I promised I will go through again so that you can take notes. I will do this now. It's the same as yesterday. I used the like to  to start with the openness, which is the central element, the spacious, open, just being. image of the space in which everything can manifest.  Some people like this image of the space, so much that they forget about the whole rest. They want to stay in space. But they space out. Yeah? It's like going somewhere where nothing can reach me. This is not how mind is. Mind is actually basically very dynamic and sensitive. And then the next good thing we need to do is then.  to remind ourselves of the fluidity of mind. Yes, you remember the water element, now the water also because of its cohesion, that everything is always connecting, then has the capacity to act as a mirror. Now the mirror is yet another example for the fluidity and unhindered manifestation. if I had a metal in my hand.  Then moving the mirror or moving something in front of the mirror, the mirror in a completely unhindered way always reflects what is presented in front. You know, it will show your face, then it will show yours, then it will, no, and there is not a moment of holding on to the image that was just there before. and you don't have to make that image go away.  It disappears in its own nature. It never had any substance. There is no need for recycling the mirror images. Somewhere put them in a bin and then recycle them. And the same thing is with our thoughts. Our thoughts, our images, our emotions that we have, they are in the fluidity, in the continuity of experience, are rising and disappearing just like images in a mirror.  We didn't do anything from childhood on, as a baby, as a child, as an adult, we never had to take care to dissolve the thoughts that were present just a moment before. They do that by themselves. This is the, this, so this image of the water, the fluidity is also pointing to the unhindered manifestation of the earth.  handed continuity of the experiences of life. This is very important to trust your own mind. Simply relax and meditation and you can trust the next experience will come. There will be no hole there suddenly. There's no hole in experience. It continues all the time.  And it has no problem with the previous experiences that disappear, that is all by themselves. No one has to take care of that. No one has to take care to create that space. No one has to take care of the continuity and fluidity of appearances. And the reason for that is the next one. We are now with the...  We have been with the space and the water, we come now to the earth. And the reason that it is like this is because whatever arises has no substance, no solidity. If it had solidity, now if something has solidity and next thing wants to take its place, it has to push it away, it has to do something. And then because it's solid, what to do with it? we have recycling bin in our brains somewhere. No, but we...  don't. It simply deserves. There is no solidity. And this is the empty nature, the not having a core, not having a substance in the experience, not finding something that would be the everlasting substance of a moment of anger. If you look at it more properly, if a moment of anger, if anger had substance then it would have been there before already.  It would have been stored and then has to arise and then go somewhere again and somehow always exist. That is not the way mindfulness works. Anger comes together through different forces. These different forces of preferring one thing and disliking another and one's own pride and one's old worldview and then the anger rises. And the moment one of these forces changes, anger's gone. I'm sorry.  different changes for something else. It is a conditioned phenomena. Conditioned phenomena are just the result of conditions. They have no substance, no solidity. As solid as it might feel or anger might sometimes feel especially when it is ranker, hatred, then it might feel solid like a rock, but even a rock is not solid. Depends on conditions.  So you have to stimulate that again and again, again and again, always making up the same. Also depression seems to be so solid sometimes, so solid, but it is actually generated again and again and again. And if you work with that within one moment of experience, it can be gone. Thank you.  There's the conditions are not there anymore. This is the empty nature of all mental states, of everything, all phenomena. I quickly tell you a story about the worst depression I have encountered. There was a young lady in the beginning of the 20s, brought by her mother, and she felt dead and  trying to talk with her, all my usual clever skills of, you know, kindling some interest in this and that everything failed. Nothing, nothing, nothing. So, after an hour with her, I said okay, let's make a break, let's you know, and we stood up and  We went towards the door. She opened the door for me and smiled at me. That was the moment where depression was not there. And that's where we started our work with each other. That one moment and she admitted it, yes, I was not depressed, I was happy to open the door for you. And that is like, that is what I mean with. in every mental state, as solid as it might be.  be, you will find the little thing which is different, you will find that it depends on conditions. And then of course, immediately after having opened the door she was back in her, the press of state, but I had noticed it. And then I could reach her. And this is what you need to know that all what we experience, all of this, and it is very reliable, this reliable like the earth, it has no substance.  Temporary experiences in mind, even if the conditions which create those experiences can be repeated and can continue for some time, but nothing is everlasting here. So we direct our attention and meditation towards that. This is like giving the sense of reliability. Wow.  I can trust that. I can trust the basically open spacious nature of mind. I can trust the continuity of experience, the unhindered experience, the empty nature. And if we were to stop here, we would have an open spacious, fluid and empty mind.  But that's not the story of life. We need to add the next aspect. It is this finely distinguishing capacity. And this remains, awakened beings, have the top capacity of distinguishing, of knowing, of understanding, of being sensitive. So that reveals more and more. And it is this finally knowing.  capacity of mind that makes life so vivid and that makes every moment unique, every experience unique. This is the freshness aspect. This is the luminous, the clarity aspect of so many experiences in life. It is this aspect of our mind which is like the light bulb in a projector. When you project a film on the screen.  you need light for the differences to show. Otherwise, if you don't have enough light, it's just a blur. But our mind has that capacity to see things so distinctly, so finely and to feel them. Not talking about the visual thing, I'm talking about, wow, really feeling the finest differences in the way I love someone, the finest differences in whatever experience there's so much  which we can feel. And this is the luminous capacity of mind. This is the fire because fire, sun, stars, fire, these are all the light elements. Here we are not talking about the worms. One can also go a little bit elaborate on the worms aspect, the loving aspect, which is also there. Oh, you're talking here.  about that luminous quality. And then, if we were to stop here with the description of awakened mind, it would be very nice already, but it would be passive. It would be a mind finally enjoying life, now attachment, very spacious, very open, fluid.  However, not interactive. So we need the active side. We need to describe that. Awakened activity. And this is due to the creative aspect of mind. It is the dynamic force, which is not only on the receiving side, You not only receive in a dynamic way all the information.  We create, we form life, actually the word is made up by the way we perceive. And the whole story of karma and what different words people experience, all of that comes from the creative aspect of mind. incredible. So here the wind element the wind is there.  You can have to say the ambassador of change, right? It's like the wind blows and depending on which wind is blowing, it's either a karmic wind, an emotional wind which is blowing of any of the kinds and colors our experience or it is. a wind of no clinging of no clinging  to yourself, which will then be a wind of sensitivity, of compassion, of interbeing. It's a different wind, which is blowing there. So the creative aspect of mind, that which gives rise to interactions with the world, with to communication, which gives rise to poetry, to drawings, to music, to gestures, and so on.  That is the creative potential of our mind. And, attuning into these five aspects, we have a very complete description of mind. Now, nothing is really missing. This is why it's so helpful. And these five facets of the same jewel of mind, these five facets, they show, Well,  the clinging becomes less when the corresponding emotions become less. There's more awareness that it's less anger, less pride, less desire, less ambition and jealousy. Like this, the natural qualities of mind they can show better. And you can do this by slightly reminding yourself in the meditation. You can.  to the normal breathing meditation. Take in the body the overall physical experience, which is mind, which is a mental experience. And you widen this to take in all the other aspects of experience.  all the thoughts, all the emotional states, all of what you can perceive of mind, and it will be, it will work much better, you will be much more relaxed if you can do this with kindness, with a very gentle attitude. Because from a judging point of view, when we breathe in and without and see what's going on our mind we would have this kind of  feeling, or what crap is that again. So then also be it in this judgment. I would like accept that. OK, yes. Make space for it. Make space. Allow yourself to be fluid. That comment will also pass. It actually has no substance. if I now start fighting with my jet.  mind, I'm fighting against something which has no substance. It is, I can see it. So already gone the moment I let it go. And this we do with everything that arises. Whatever arises, we breathe through with the understanding of these five aspects. Now only in the beginning you have to remind yourself of these five aspects. aspects, they will become so natural to  you will not need to name them to yourself. Because actually seeing one of these aspects you see the other ones as That's where. So you will be breathing along everything to arise.  And of course, allowing it to go its own way, and in that the understanding we get deeper, that you can really trust this process, and it will also continue when you are not paying attention to the breathing. It's not dependent on the breath. breathing is just so that we always have some time.  to return to in case we need it, in case we are taken on a long journey by our daydreams. Okay, come back. And the breathing is spacious, the breathing is fluid, there's no substance. It's always different, it is very vivid and fresh, and it is creative. It's the wind.  and the way we breathe already makes a different world. And to finish this explanation I would like to share a wonderful bit of a biography with you. I think it was Langley Tanpa, one of these great bodhisattvas in Tibet. and he was quite old. He was in his 50s already.  He was in his 50s already when he got to know the teachings of Bodhi Tita, on this awakened mind. You know, 50 was an advanced aged antivate that didn't live so long. And he made the vow.  into the wish from now on until I die, until my last breath. May every breath be connected to bodhicitta. And when he died, he said to his disciples, my wall, my wish has been fulfilled. One of the great masters and it's incredible.  example to me, to many of us, why not connect as many cycles of breathing to whatever means bodhicitta to you? What you feel most inspired by, connected to that. You don't have to call it bodhicitta. If you want to call it love, connect it to love. If you want to connect it to generosity, connect it to that. If you call it Friendship, connect it to Friends.  Whatever is the quality, even you know, like it can be simplicity and connected to that. Use your inspiration and connect every in-breath and every out-breath to that. And then you will have a fulfilled life. The more that is possible, the life will be fulfilled.  and you will die happily. I mean, leave this body home since no one is really dying. You will leave this body and continue happily without breathing. You have become so used to being in that quality. You don't need the breath anymore at that time.  I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm sorry.  Thank you.",
    "11.mp3": " I'm going to offer to you now another improvisation on the theme of awareness with breathing because that seems to be a common ground for people practicing Vipassana and Mahamudra. Going a little, they cannot, you cannot hear me in the back. It's probably the problem with the position of the microphone. That's better. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, much better.  Yes. And then because this is a good opportunity to speak with all of you at five o'clock we will do a question and answer session. Like yesterday some of you can put some questions and I will respond to them. In the meantime I will be able to read also the many little notes with other questions.  So, those of you who like, let's go on a journey together. journey for me when I meditate always starts with dropping ideas.  about what needs to happen, what should happen, no ideas. I will be just surprised as you, what will come now. But the breathing will be our guide that's always there, and you feed it already, breathing in, and breathing out.  And I noticed that my body is making lights, wings, and actually this fluidity in the body helps me to open their hearts. You might feel for yourself as well. That is slight dance. This is if you were a little bit dancing with the breath.  Yes, so did we already spoke about this little self massage. This is actually the same phenomenon.  letting the chest participate in the dance. I'm going to feel some pain, I open up to it. you  Don't drive it away. Hoping I've been breathing into that area with the deepest acceptance which is possible. the the fluidity of the fluid.  to traverse up on the hard region to the spine. And it goes down all the way into the lumber region, into the pelvic area.  Maybe we are a little bit like a bamboo or a strong grass or a young tree and a wind. A soft breath, a twist breeze, is moving, is moving the body. you  Actually the breeze is our own breathing.  The lower body also participates however a little bit different it's more like the roots, I like the roots of the tree giving stability to the movement of the spine.  So breathing in and breathing out, we experience the whole breathing body. I'm going to get you a little bit more.  From the roots to the tip, and we allow for this tiny movement.  you  Everyone decides for herself, for himself, just how much of that is helpful in which way you want to allow this movement. The very center.  And when we feel emotions, when we feel, when the thoughts are passing through, we are aware that the physical sensation changes along. So breathing in and breathing out where aware of all these subtle changes.  And then of course, this you  mental phenomena, these mental processes, that we see a little bit more of our attention. Before we go too far into ordinary thinking, the Buddha encourages us to feel the joy of relaxation, that happiness of body and mind.  In the middle of the pain, there is also the wet accession. It's quite incredible.  The Buddha very clearly talks here about feeling the joy and the mind and and the body. And this is the basis to continue the journey.  Try to find a little bit of that. Maybe just a little glimpse of inner ease and well-being.  Breathe with it, breathe into it, let the body dance, let it continue to be so fluid. you  It's a little bit like being massaged by gender waves in the ocean.  And return to the state of the mind itself deeper inside beyond the thinking processes. you  We feel our own level of tension. And we flow with it, breathing in, breathing art.  And why we are very conscious of this? and wide, here to big.  conscious of that spacious dimension of mind in which all of this is happening. As if we were watching the dancing of clouds in endless space. the way.  And the Prana is that karmic energy, that energy created by all the impressions stored in our mind, living in our mind is better to say. Forming the way we perceive the world. So these are the pranic winds, you can say.  And we make space for them. If we allow them to pass through and we manage, not to react in the habitual way, this is called the purification of karma. It is actually the possibility.  until that these energies can transform as they become conscious. And they become energies of wisdom. We call it wisdom prana and Sanskrit jnana prana, the timeless awareness energies. Thank you.  So it's the space, this enormous spacious awareness with this equanimity of not reacting, you  into a weak evening with attachment to version. This spacious awareness allows for even deeper layers in us to show the dynamic nature.  Thank you.  And we mind it of experiences in the mountains, and sometimes the clouds are densely packed below in the valleys. And as the atmosphere becomes lighter as the day rises, then these clouds that come up begin to dissolve.  in the warm air. And this is what happens in mind as well, the deeper layers, the rise of some of it becomes conscious, not everything. Much of it just desires, without giving rise to thoughts.  And without knowing it, we actually Thank you.  We actually can even do this connected to others because we feel so much, we vibrate, we resonate so much with those people around us. So there is a Buddhist satvah practice called Tong Leng, which is breathing in.  And you imagine that you had the capacity to breathe in from the valleys around you. This clouds. And then you invite also the tension and suffering of others to come into your heart, which which is the spacious warm awareness.  and which things can dissolve. Nothing to do, just the same way as if we were on a mountain peak, we can see many valleys. The same way our heart-mind can feel many streams of being.  So let us continue breathing a little bit like that and you only do what you feel like. Don't feel pressured by me or by these descriptions. Allow yourself to be breathing in a spacious awareness. Remember  to allow for the subtle dance of your body.  you  you  you  And remember to take a pause from time to time. These fantastic pauses, they can be anywhere in our practice.  you  you  And perhaps you see how it is. More certainly you see a little bit more than at the beginning of the practice. and  and the standing is there.  you  you  you  I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm sorry.  The practice which we shared which has happened, I have never done it exactly like this before. It is also completely new example with the mountain top.  clothes and so on. All of this is completely fresh, it's not part of the repair to our this because we are sitting together, that's how it happens because we share. That's how. But basically for you who want to know the structure of what we were doing, we were following the same four sati-patanas, yes, as you know, body, physical formations, man.  into formations, mental movements, mind is such, and then the understanding of the seeing. So the four Satyipatanas, which the Buddha thought they were there, and what happened is that, as I said, don't have felt a great pain in the heart, right? So, okay, accepted. Yes, then dance with it, breathe with it. So then...  I was thinking maybe it has something to do with all of us. Yes, maybe it is my own body, being a body of resonance. So we use our body like that. We take good care. So first, we take good care of our body. You take good care of the body. You don't really know for how others people should do it. I have to, you know, you can't tell anybody. So...  Best thing is to let the breath flow through and to allow for those movements to advise, that want to advise and they are pretty natural actually, they are very smaller but we know that our body has different rhythms and there are pulsations that are so to allow for whatever wants to manifest is the best thing not to block because one thing is for sure that when I get that  to be in a block somewhere, it's clear. So I have to dance around. So the breathing was starting from the heart and then it went upwards in my case and it let you participate in that because I do believe in this phenomenon of resonance that we are connected. So I do believe it could be helpful and then the movement was going downwards. Yes, and then I felt, okay, the breathing of the legs today is different. you  have more this element of stability, this stability on the ground, giving like the roots of whatever, a young tree. And this is very often the case, of course, this has not happened for the first time, but it's also when you sit on a chair you can do like this, you sit with the feet down, you spread out a little bit so that the same angle like when sitting cross-legged,  your feet touch the ground and then also on the chair, your basin is completely free to move forward, backward, sideways. Yeah, it's like this freedom of movement, this is what we need. Now, when you lean, then it won't be possible, but the more you move up in front in the chair, then you liberate your basin. And actually, what you do, you liberate all these energies. and the breath does it.  for you. But just continue breathing and follow the breathing as it wants to move, it moves anyhow. So you see when I breathe in there is maybe a nature stretching off the body, even without it, maybe a nature relaxation of the body. You know, like you find your own way. There's no good and right way to do it. Just whatever is most necessary.  That was the part with the physical formations and in that we accept all the sensations that arise, you know, the good old technique of our practitioners, no attachment, no version to whatever arises, making space. So you can say this was already because of the loving kindness involved, this was kind of a meta-meditation icon.  might even say with itchita meditation, including the body. And using the body as a resonance. And then within that, remember I told you, you can feel how thoughts and emotions reflect on the body. Now, we were a little bit quick in that I admit. But for seasoned practitioners who have been practicing a long time, You become aware that you cannot have a single thought with...  without a reflection in the body is impossible. The prana of the mental movements, and the prana of the physical sensations they go together. I touched on the subject yesterday a little bit, and Tibetan it's called long sam yanme, long means prana, sam mind, yanme in separable. And this is the inseparability of prana and mind of subtle  energies on mind, there's a very important understanding that we work with in Mahamudra. So we never separate the two. Because this body is not considered material, it is energy. We know it from physics, biochemistry, and so on, from biology. This body only seems material, actually. To the last bit of the of the cells inside the bonds.  everything is in constant movement. All these serds are breathing. You know, we're talking biology, we talk about the breathing of the sers, the cellar of breathing. This is the osmotic exchange with the surrounding suns on. And this happens all the time. And now we even know that the brain serds are continuing to breathe and to change until the end of the life. It's all the time. the bones as well. So there's no  part, exempt of that. And this was known to the old yogis, you know, more than 2000 years ago, they knew this. They considered this body to be a car now. And the mental movements, the second part of Satyipadhama is the mental formations. This is the expressive part of mind where we think, We have images, memories, certain ideas. Much of...  this is non-conceptual movement but its movement is like impises, like for example she makes a sound and I look what this sound is, it's actually just the scratching of the pen on her paper, right? So now I found out what it is. But the intention to move it was not conceptual, it was non-conceptual interest what's going on and like this we have  many non-concept movements constantly. Even, you know, it comes out with concepts now, what I'm saying, the words come out and they are concepts of course. But if you watch yourself talking, if you talk very fluently to someone you like or where you're not afraid, you're not formulating your phrases before and then you spit them out. No, no, no. Actually, none.  conceptually you already know what you want to express and the expression then comes and then it forms. So it's actually what we call the concepts, the words, in the same way the conceptual mind. This is the last product of a very creative mind. It's the end of it. You can call it also the tip of the iceberg if you want. The rest is underneath, under the surface this means mostly unconscious. But if you're  practitioner of deep mindfulness, then you begin to know more and more of what happens under the surface. You are able to see underwater. Okay? And you put on your Googles, your glasses, yes, Googles, I think, Googles, then you can see underwater. And this is when we sit in meditation, actually, what we do is we put on our Grogards. I'm meditating now means I put on my Grogards.  That means I can see more now, I know too much more, because I keep everything still, keeping everything still. I am at a very fine awareness of what is going on. And suddenly I begin to discover what other people call the subconscious. For Buddhist practitioners, what others call unconscious or subconscious is only pre-conscious.  Because the consciousness can reach there. And this is what we do in meditation. We go to the less conscious level of our experience and they come into mind. And that's where you think that you have more thoughts than before. You think, wow, this is crazy. I have never been thinking so much. Now you only discover now. You have been thinking that much at least before. And now you discover because...  because you have your govards on, because then you can see the small fish, right? Before you only saw those jumping out of the water, and only those fish existed, and those where you looked and then the big ones you could see from above. But now that you have this sensitivity and the calm mind, suddenly you see all the swarms of small fish. Wow! What a life is going on there. And this is  the so-called subconscious life, but it's enormous. And it's actually what nourishes the oceans. That's where the life is going on, and you can go down to the plumb tunnel everywhere. You know, it's like we are only at the little fish now, but you can go even finer. Okay. So this is what we call men to movements. This is the second of the Satyamadhanas. And the third one, which the Buddha called...  mind, chitta, then actually this is beginning to taste the ocean, tasting the water. If I stay in the example, you know, it doesn't have to do with movement so much anymore. You will see that that what we call the taste of our mental experience is also related to movement but not so obviously. For example, you can feel sad or editable.  or light, bright, happy, without having thoughts right now going on. There is this feeling as if your mind had a taste, there is the taste of sadness, or it has the taste of lightness, of freedom. But you cannot identify a movement right away that would be causing that feeling. you  It's like the momentary soup we are swimming in, here has a certain taste. And this is, you can say, I mean, this is absolutely, this is more than clever, it's a Buddha was a genius in describing us this because it is due to which, which comic soup we are into, that the mental movements, the thoughts will arise. The device from that...  disposition. A narrow, fearful mind will give rise to fearful mental movements, but it doesn't always need to have those movements. It's already tense without experiencing movements. And this is the subconscious mind. For most people it becomes conscious to the practitioner. the practitioners, they will be able, you know, if you're really good and  your mind, then this is like you present an unknown soup to a good cook. And you ask him or her, what are the different spices in this soup? First thing I can feel is a slight taste of set us.  And then I feel interested, some joy, some keen interest. Oh, and then there is a lot of fear. Oh, and there is an underground happiness, a yearning even for living with happiness. And you go like this, you know, and you will feel that your mind is not one mind, but actually it has different tastes to it like this.  different spices in a soup. And depending on where we direct our attention, then one of these aspects becomes to be dominant. So a sad person and deep depression is not aware of the other elements of what he or she is feeling. So she is so sad, so depressed that she is unaware of the love that you have.  fields. And in therapy we need to become aware not to make the depression aware but to be aware that there's something else going on. That is love. And of course we always find fear. But in depression we find so much anger also. And sorry to say if you have been through it but we always find pride. Always depression without pride doesn't exist. It's inverted pride, it's often the pride of...  of being new, of being stupid, of, but it's self-concerned. And we find these layers. So, and they are not layers like an cake, where one is above the others, but it's a field with various tastes. And this is what the Buddha wanted us to explore in the third Satyipadhana. He gives examples from white to narrow, All right.  from liberated to imprisoned, from sad, to happy, and this you can read in the Saty Patana, where he gives those examples, in the Saty Patana, so to. And this was, this is a typical Asian way of saying, you know, when you say small or big, it means look at the size of something. If you say sweet and sour, you look at the taste of something.  Yeah, they just named the two poles and the practitioner asked to feel just how free is the mind now? How open is it? Just how is it? And this is possible to explore when thanks to the previous two satis, coming the physical formations, coming the mental formations, Then the mind has to become ready.  clear and then it's possible to feel the taste. You know, like someone who wants to taste the next wine or eat the next soup, it's better to have clear water to rinse the mouth, you know, so that you have a clear taste of what's going on. So you have to let the mind become clear of the preceding impressions and then you can and feel those deeper layers of what's going on.  of who you are actually. And as a natural consequence of that, so if we do not get attached to the calm, which arises through the different tastes, to all of that, then we liberate the mind from all clinging to what's going on and what we feel. And that's when we have no preconceived ideas anymore. That's when the seeing happens.  That's the fourth, third, this is seeing the nature of experiences. And this seeing will always happen when there is a certain degree of clarity that you have managed to come to a certain degree of calm. There is more understanding of yourself and the world. Now in the meditation we were sharing.  Then I did what I definitely didn't want to do. I came here to Israel and I thought, the people which I meet, I would not introduce them to Tonglin. It's one thing I won't do. It's this giving and taking and this bodhicitta practice and so on, but the way it happened then, it felt most natural. I was just talking to you about the other values, which you can also see from the  top of a mountain, that you can create an atmosphere in which even the suffering of others can dissolve. So that is actually Buddhist Sardvah practice of Satyipatana. So you feel your own man's state, that this man's state is not separate from the others around. Very often we feel, if you taste of emotions that we kind of...  understand not to be quite ours. And yet we treat them as ours. We breeze them in and we breathe out, we breathe through them. And it doesn't matter from where they come, wherever the clouds come from, we take them. We are the space above the mountains. We are, this is in the heart. It's in the heart, mind. There is this space.  And if we have properly taken care of ourselves, then we can open up to what concerns others. And then that is not a difference. It doesn't make a difference. We just continue breathing with whatever arises. And we don't solidify any of that. That's why clouds are such a good example. Clouds are just really difficult to solidify. Okay, sometimes they become here, but... Okay, normally  It's more like evaporating. Yes, it's like. And this is what is a perfect example of what happens in our heart. When our awareness goes into some emotional state, connecting with some emotional movements or tastes, it evaporates. And that spacious awareness of non-clinging. Whenever there is no clinging, there is spacious awareness. It's very easy.  You don't have to create that spacious awareness. It's there as soon as there is no clinging. You get that? This is very, very easy and important. No clinging. This means not opposing also, not holding on and not opposing, not clinging on a version. So it's like space. Things happen and since there is no one...  grasping, no one fighting. Hey, space is there. Wow, it's the basic principle of martial arts. Yes? Attack gives space. Yeah, so the energy moves through, moves through. Let the energies move through. And the best way to learn that, or one good way, is with breathing. Because that's natural movement, it's naturally connected to space.  So it's a good example to learn how to deal with emotions. So it was the explanation of what we were practicing. Oh my god it's on time and on time.  Deep breathing. Let's sing the Tardamantra. Like this I will use more time. Look you asked me the Tardamantra and another was you have put it on the board. You will see it written somewhere. It's just that she wrote the Tibetan version which ends with so hot and the Sanskrit version you  I was singing with you answers, Svaha, same story. Om, Tari, Tuh, Tari, Tuh, the Soha, Svaha. Now the Om is the universe is syllable in the Indian subcontinent and it refers to the origin of sounds, which for the Buddhist practitioner  is the origin of awareness. So with arm, we call on the wisdom of our Buddhas. We invite the awareness wisdom of all enlightened ones. This is the meaning of arm and Buddhist mantras. T\u0101ri is the declination of t\u0101r\u0101, which means she, the one who liberates. the word tada means li-  If you can do that in English, in French we can do that. So she who liverates, and that's an activity of an awakened being. She is the great mother, which liverates all sentient beings, who does her best to do so. Of course she needs our help, because no one can liver it, but she is there to help us. Um ta de tuta de  The two before the taredi is an emphasis, is like full liberation, something like that. And on taredi to taredi, so liberates, people liberates, completely liberates, and today, and she does it quickly. to lei and to lei means fast swift rapidly quick. She is  the quickest one among the bodhisattvas and bodhisattvas, because he's like a mother, and you have never seen anyone quicker than a mother whose child is in danger. That's the quickest thing you can see on earth, yes? And you know of the stories that a mother has lifted a track to pull a child from underneath and so on. You know, no thoughts, just do it. And this is the energy that is mantra communique.  the two days is for this swift action of being there. So the bodhicitta mind, embodied by the great mother called T\u0101r\u0101, liberates us swiftly and so-ha, sv\u0101h\u0101 means so be it. May it be so that by the wisdom of all the Buddhas, the  Quick liberation of curse right now. This is like the meaning of the mantra. Okay, I don't know if it helps you. I always forget about the meaning of the mantra. I just like it. And to know the meaning of course helps to open up to it. And you don't need to think that that is an angel living somewhere in space called Tala. You don't have to solidify her.  It's more an energy of bodhicitta, of compassion, that manifests when needed in many different forms. Countless colors, countless forms. But the story goes that she took the vow to always come back as a woman, always, because that's the more difficult position to be in. and there needs to be reinforcement for the  female side on this planet. So she took the vow. There are so many male bodhisattvas already. Let's strengthen women's liver. That's the mantra of women's liver actually. Men practice it just as well. I practice a lot of tarda and have a great benefit of that. But, yes, so...  Let's sing it together. I want to hear you, those who like it, I want to hear you loud. At a certain time, I will reduce my voice and I want to hear you. Okay? Because I heard that some of you want to take it home and then you need to be able to sing it. Oh  I am into a time, into a day, Swahar, I am time, into a time, And I'll be into this world.  Oh, I'm dead into and I'm dead into this world.

And of course I'm not a great expert in that. But I did go through very painful periods in my life. Yes, sometimes up to six months or something like this. from the Dharma point of view 1.  can say a little bit about it. Let us first use our imagination to think, to imagine that we have pains in one part of the body, or maybe most parts of the body, like all the time.  like many people have, or extremities, or some people have constant back pain, or other people have so many headaches, and so on and so on, and they are of course very painful diseases. You see it would deal with  short pain for a few hours, a day or two. It's okay because we still have some reserves, we have some energy. So we can make up for it. And that is much easier. Then afterwards when the pain is gone we can recover. And when it comes again, again we  We have little buffer, here we have a little energy. But when the pain is there, no matter whether it is short or long, the first thing we do, the first practice is not to tense the mind around that. What is we have talked about? It is...  or have we said in casual words, we say not to make a drama of it, but maybe we can find better words and say, okay, not to give it all that much importance in our lives, to keep it as what it is that is pain, but there is so much more to life than the pain.  And this is one of the first moves in our practice with awareness, is that we actually do not focus on the pain, but on our, which is still there, which is accessible. Some pains, like headache, they can dial the mind, they can make it impossible to see, they create nausea and so on, so then, of course. but hey  is still always so much more. For example, the capacity to love is not impaired by pain. And compassion is not getting smaller, it can even grow. Thinking of all those who share similar pains right now. So we open up and  We discover all what is not pain. And this is a lot, you should know. There is still a lot there. And one of the sub-catalogories, you can sense the sub-practices of that, is to find one area of that which is not pain, where we can stabilize our attack.  to rest there. For example, if breathing is not painful, then really to rest with the breathing and not to focus on the joints. Or if we can stay with the love or with the spacious awareness to stay with that aspect of our being and not to let ourselves be sucked into the pain. is that what usually happens there?  pain, pulsating, shooting, pains, vibrating, pain, staring pains, you know there are so many kinds that tend to attract our attention. Now we learn to not follow that attraction and to be able to rest another areas of our experience. This reduces enormously.  already what we experience, you know, as the, you can say the mental pain, the emotional pain, yes? There's so much less. And in that area, another practice is that we see there's so much Okay.  We still have the capacity of compassion. And then we can take the pain as a teacher. Wow, that's another step, that's a big step. But we are forced to do it. Those who have chronic pains, they cannot do differently. They are finished by taking their pains as a teacher, because the rest is just a struggle. So  I mean of course some people struggle to the end, but those who give way and then actually they find ways to learn from their pain. Now one of the very helpful ways is to say, I will learn everything from this pain, how How to live with it, how to be happy with it, how to deal with it.  so that I can share it with others. And actually, one does not even need that contact with others in the as a part of the Tonglin practice that we were already doing. We completely accept our pain. We breathe it in. Yeah, it was the inverse. We open up, because this is the disagreeable experience. We will open up into. and we go and...  that very warm, spacious awareness. And we send love, support, into the areas that are painful. Of course, there are visualizations with nectar, light and so on. This can all be used. But the basic attitude is, by me taking on the pain, not resisting it, and may it become  easier for everybody else to accept and to work and to live through similar pains. It's a very strong wish of compassion that by me accepting it, accepting it completely, taking it on, not resisting it, finding ways with it to remain relaxed, then may this you  make it easier for all those in the world. I don't even know how, but I know that they are somewhere who have similar challenges. And to do this again and again, really changes a lot. Now you may wonder, does it take the pain away?  Sometimes here, sometimes now, mostly now. Mostly now. But since the resistance is gone, pain changes the experience of pain changes. It becomes more like intensity. I don't know if you can feel the difference. the paint, the what paint is.  very intense feeling that is painful to which we still resist. But when the just the intensity is there without the resistance, it's a very different feeling. Somehow it is still painful, disagreeable, it might even be disabling, without things we cannot do.  But when we are being asked if it is very painful, we feel like saying, oh, it's very intense. We cannot really say any more, it is painful because the judge went the classification of that as pain has left. And it is a very intense teacher visiting. Yes, very intense very intense  Guru is there. Yes? Heavyweight champion, Guru. You know, this kind of Guru, a kind of wow. And so this is all in the area of finding out about that we are so much else and that the ways of changing the view, accepting it, then even taking it as a teacher. but that  a physical ways of practicing with pain as well. Now the best example is when you have pain not everywhere but you have pain in one area of your body like at the root of a tooth or in the knee or in the shoulder like a soccer So to speak, a frozen shoulder, completely painful.  You can't even lift it anymore and every movement is painful or at least after certain degree it's painful. And then one practice is where you can use your shammadaya, your trained mindfulness, is to go all around the pain. the area around the tools area around.  You don't go to inside the pain, but you relax everything around. So you walk around the pain wherever it is. And you bring in relaxation everywhere. Like when I had my, how do you say that? this is called Spinal Hania, like the disc Hania here, here are the accident huh?  Yes. So this was due to a football accident in use and then later on at the age of 40, I had to slip this gear, this is the word. And it was extremely painful day and night for eight months. I remember that very well. And I didn't take an operation, it healed like that, but it took very long. It was eight months before I could sleep.  at night without pain for the first time. And of course I went to osteopathy and so on, but it didn't have right away. But the discovery was, and this was nice for me to discuss with the osteopathy also, that I was doing this practice of relaxing all around. So when you relax all around,  continue always relaxing all around. The pain stays located and for example normally was a slip disc then your whole spine would be in tension. You know the pain would make the protective tension travel up and down and everything would be under tension and the pens like this, they tend to spread. We have a toothache and it is really here.  and you kind of, you tense all around. And you can avoid that by doing the practice of really moving all around and relaxing. This means like putting like an envelope of loving acceptance and relaxation around the pain. Okay, this is one way of already reducing it physically. physically and that helps a lot.  Of course, for these tensions also, then to do this kind of showering practice like Gwanga is teaching you now to flush through the body, you know, with all the body sensations, and to do it again and again, to stay then with the palms of your hands and the sorts of your feet, and to let the energy flow out, that is in addition very, very helpful if you know how to do it.  that, yeah, it's very, very helpful. And then there comes the third practice, which is to directly go into the pain. Takes courage, but to go with your awareness, directly into the place where you feel the strongest pain, not around, directly in what seems to be the center. I'm sorry.  And to stay there. And to stay there. If you don't keep up the distance of the observer observing the pain and labeling it pain, but if you really go into it, you can make some surprising discoveries. you  at least for a moment, the pain disappears. Then usually it comes back, if it has a physical origin, it doesn't stay away, but already it is very interesting that it can disappear. And if you can stay there with some stability, if you have a well developed Charmata, way for a longer period an hour or two depending on  how long you can stay relaxed with that. You can try it out for chronic illnesses especially if there are pains in the whole body, this hardly works. Honestly, it's not something that is so easy. It works better with a toothache. Yeah, because it's a located pain. Then it's easier. but with an overall pain. Actually, yeah.  Yes, then a practice that you would do would be an overall disidentification with the body. It is very important then to meditate on the body as not being me. And this is good when you do it lying down. If you are paying for the whole body, then good to lie down. Yes to feel.  the body, but to get out of that feeling that it's my body which is pain, it is just intense sensation and no one owns this body. And that incredibly reduces the pain. It won't Probably go away, it can, but usually it becomes much, much less. This I was doing...  when I had corona. Now, this was my body was in a cute pain all over, every part of it. And for three days, something like this, and then it was over. But in the recent times, what I remember these were the most painful days, probably, in my recent experience. So then we need to do that. And especially if on top you have fever and so on, then is a complete giving up.  and the disidentification with all these processes that are going on. There's an extremely leave due to that. The body still continues. Does this work? You know? Is healing, hopefully? If it is an infection like that, but you are not doing. So it's the same attitude as a meditation, what we are doing now. this meditation of  doing, actually you apply that then to the painful state. And it's a non-doing presence and you have to keep it up day and night because it's there all the time. So it's intense practice. And for me, for example, I even had a high fever and I even had what you call that hallucinations. You know, this kind of fever fantasy.  mind, mind, wild. And also that, you need to deal, non-identification. So, everything is fine. You are completely free, intensity and the body, very active mind, but there is a sense of peace, of freedom, in the whole process. So I want to talk to you about these things have been asked to give...  few instructions about this, maybe it encourages you to try out a little different approaches, you know, can try out different means. And from time to time, maybe a piece of chocolate or something, you know, not try so hard. Yes, and then you move and you distract yourself, and maybe you see a movie or something. Yes, so don't try.  to be a super man, super woman. But anyhow, the pain we catch you, we catch us, and then we have to practice again, because we just cannot avoid it. So this is why it's a teacher. It's unavoidable. And it makes us grow in ways that we wouldn't dare to imagine and we would never make prayers for that. It forces us to...  grow to open up to what we think is impossible. And some people have a history of pain when they think back to their first small pains when they started and then how it got bigger. And how even the bigger pains now are easier than the first small pains. Incredible, incredible what we can learn, how we can learn to be, to remain relaxed, you  to do our normal things, to lead a normal life, while all of that is going on. So it's an incredible learning process, and the best of it is a lot of compassion comes from it, and the pride goes close to zero. Yeah, somewhere we have pains, or it's not, you know, whew! The pride goes like that. Add this is...  It's such a beautiful thing. Already for that, already for that, because it makes us so soft. It makes us so unassuming, we say, in English, which means, and not unpretentious, not trying to be on top of the world. We cannot, we just simply don't have the force for that. So, we don't have the energy to be proud. and so we need.  help, we need softness, we are softness others. You know, we need love, we give love and things are much easier actually because the pain works as it's like, you know, needing a dough, you know, when you need a dough for like a pizza and you beat it and you know, and the pain is doing that with us. It is...  It is working us, it is acting. And first we still try to maintain our normal self. We resist, we don't know. I can do. I can continue. And I continue typing my email while I have the headache or the shoulder, I can so on. I try to maintain as long as possible until it's not possible anymore. And then comes the softening. Then comes the giving in, okay, I give myself a break, okay.  Hey, maybe today I don't go to work. Yes, and so on. Maybe I have to cancel this and cancel that. And then, then comes the whole softening process. And this softening process, this is where the big learning happens. This is where you can find marvelous people. And when you listen to them, Wow, years of pain.  Or maybe a friend of mine, when I asked him, you know, very special capacities, also very compassionate. Seven years of his childhood, he passed and met, he spent and met because of pains. When you are adolescent and you have to spend seven years of your adolescent time and bad. What does that do with you? You know? Wow.  And like this, I hope this is a little encouragement for you that maybe you experiment a little with the next paints which come along. Well, thank you for the question.  Thank you.",

If you relax the mind, it will liberate itself. It will loosen up.  However, to get the full benefit of that, we need to relax for a long time. So, for example, those lying down, feeling tired, they need the patience to relax and to relax. And maybe for the sleep, and then when the wake-up, continue relaxing. Then the full clarity of mind shows.  Then you see how it is naturally clear.  When we have full days of practice and we do not distract ourselves, we can lie down as much as we want. Then after a while we cannot lie anymore. It sits up, the mind becomes clear and we stay.  relaxed, we stay open. Then, now, and day and night, day and night follow each other, very relaxed. and you will see how true that is. My deliverance itself.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.

    "10.mp3": " I received four notes today on the board, two and two. Two people wanted to know about the mantra, and that I repeat the words, and that I explained it a little bit maybe. And two people said, can you please talk about death? How to become more familiar with my own death and dying and the fear of that? The two go well together.  But I want to start a little bit differently. And to start, I would come to those questions. I've read them, I've heard them, they will be answered. No, maybe never answered, but I will try my best. When living this life of a Dharma teacher, We just, you know, called Lama but...  since I'm also a medical doctor and involved in therapy and so on. Then many people come to me with suffering. Many. It's been my life. Yes, it's been that's already as a Buddhist monk. I was a Buddhist monk for 21 years. I was not only guiding the retreats, but I was the resident doctor of the monastery it's 250 people.  60 volunteers among them and many visitors from the outside. So I saw many, many people and I accompanied many people when dying also, when in terminal illness. I remember this young man with five children dying of brain cancer. situations like that, you don't want to live them actually.  But they happen all the time, and you probably have lived that as well. You have lived many difficult situations. And the one question that is always, what is compassion in such situations? And am I allowed to be happy when others suffer? Or when there is so much suffering around? Am I allowed to be happy? and I'm sitting at the bed.  of someone in the process of leaving this world. And my, what is my role when I come to visit a family, like I visited this family afterwards, I talked with the five children, where just lost their father. And I came to a very clear answer, Very clear and this is what I want to share.  I wish you. It is almost my duty to be happy. I can be of most service when people are in distress, when I myself keep a free mind. When I find ways to be in touch with my joy, with my happiness, without not going into this overboding happiness come on the world is nice and so on you know.  Yeah, you know, painted all in pink and it will be better. No, no, no, not this. That is the sensitive joy, the sensitive happiness. It's some, it is this joy you carry deep inside and which nourishes you and which nourishes me and which gives me the strength to go through difficult situations. I don't despair. So I can read.  little bit in your face is that you know it doesn't need much that you have gone through difficult times everybody everywhere and yes and then I can imagine that some of you somehow don't even dare to be happy that it is just almost almost forbidden to be joyful and  Actually, when I received his instructions from my teacher, again, O'Rimpertrim, he said, you have one job as a lama, one job. Every day to contact the source of blessings, the source of true happiness. That's my job. wherever the challenges are.  Whatever I do in my life accompanying those with of course lots of emotional problems, that's what they seek me out for, lots of Dharma questions, but lot of illness and dying and so on, distress, yeah, that's when you go and see a spiritual guide. And then my job is not how I answer how I deal with it. My job is in the end of...  Why my teacher said it to me, my job is to be deep inside, to be connected, to be connected to the source. And this is what I wish that you have the courage to do, so that the moment you feel that as an opening, you can go along and it can all become lighter for those moments which you share with others. And then there's moments to be serious.  again, there are moments to cry together, just to share sorrow. And then again, there is this lightness because we are still connected to the source. So basically what I will share with you this week is again and again in many different ways connecting to the source. And this is the the real meaning of religion, to connect us back.  with that which is actually the most inspiring. We would call it the refuge. And this is to always be in the refuge, at least one moment per day. I call it my moment of touch down. Yes? So I have translated it in this like in football, when you go for the touch down, you know, American football, you know, this is the idea, okay. I'm sorry.  touch ground, all the practice, whatever I practice, my morning practice, I usually, my the aim of my morning practice is not to attain Nirvana, it's to have my daily touch down. Yeah, that's the, okay, and then how to get there is how to be able to relax with the present problems.  I'm also the CEO of a non-profit organization, which has lots of construction work to do and so on. There's lots of challenges I had to renew my whole team and so lots of challenges. You know the usual ones, like you have all the time. And there would always be a chance, you know, there's enough opportunity to get worried. There's enough opportunity to think this world is a bad place. And there is enough, this...  enough stuff to say I'm fed up. Come on, but is that why in this world that was a bad decision? No, no, I take that back. But now it doesn't happen for as long as I'm able to experience this touchdown. You know, touching down into the source.  That's it. That is a daily reminder. It's not a reminder coming through the intellect. It's a reminder of what we are here for, coming from experience. Now my whole meditation teaching is all about that. Just kind of taking you with me somehow for those touchdowns. And that's why I like to do this guided meditations, about.  or to be connected. And I do exactly with my own mind what I teach to you, what I share with you. I don't do something else. I'm very bad at teaching things which I don't do myself. These kinds of methods, structures. I have taught them all at the time when I was still using them. them. I can teach you, you know, the way of doing.  normal shamata practice and so on. But I will immediately slide over and doing Mahamuda shamata because that's what I do. I can tell you how to meditate on a visual object. We can maybe do that again. It's fun. But of course, I will begin then teaching to you, oh yeah, look at the object, but maybe you can look through the object, maybe the object at the space, now can be.  between the rose, Mary and so on. The space between the flowers can be more inspiring than the flowers themselves, you know, just relate to space and relate to the object. So this would be a little bit different way than the usual way of meditating shaman time. It would be the Mahamudra way of relating to situations. So when I hear sorrow, when I hear big pain, Yes, I got  along with that, but I'm not caught in it. You understand? Because I've learned to experience the space at the same time. When things go wrong, there's always space around that which is going wrong. You know, a flat tire in the middle of the sun heat, you know, is something really going wrong when you want to go somewhere but it says mind a little example.  But why make it into the central thing to get upset? And now you can enlarge this to the bigger things of your life. And death also is one of those little things which we make big. Everyone has managed to die so far. It's no exception. Dying doesn't seem to be the difficult thing. It's the suffering before. And the unknown afterwards. The egg.  The actual moment of dying is more like actually then after saying goodbye to actually leave. The saying goodbye is maybe difficult, but the moment you are decided and you let go, it's just like closing the car door and drive. Go on, and you need to do the next touchdown. Because what's left to do when we die? The solution process.  what will happen, we go for a touchdown. What we go into the source. And if we know how to do that and we have done it all our life, then leaving this body will not be so difficult. We just go for another meditation. And when we come back on the other side, we continue to meditate. We just do it because we have done it on our life.  Sounds simple, sounds almost too simple to believe, but it works. And when with this confidence and this lightness I can sit at the bed of someone just dying and we can share the Dharma like this, of course it helps. Why should I be in distress just because someone is going for the next session of meditation? You know? Doesn't make sense.  We have to accept. Yes, you have five children. Yes, and we try to see that they are well taken care of. Yes, and of course you have to say goodbye. All of this could be heartbreaking. But there's also all the love you share. There's all the wonderful things you can appreciate. that is space to see more of just the focus of suffering. As always more.  And this is the basic teaching of Mahmoudra. We could call it, it's to open up to a panoramic perspective. We don't only have this place. We don't only have this country. We don't only have the Middle East. We have a whole planet and even the planet is not the only thing. Let go wide, go wide. What is the inner planet of your mind? Which planet?  you want to live on, which planet you want to give your energy to? Hey, there is space. Now when people are suffering, and this is the problem already, when the Buddha described suffering, we describe Dukha, he described this narrowing down. When there is Dukha, this means there is clinging. clinging means there is a narrowing, the spaciousness gets lost. When there is insight into the ungrasp of nature, the changing...  the impermanent nature, then there's a letting go of the grasping and the space opens. We become fluid again. And actually these are moments of touchdown. Some of them prepare the actual touchdown and the others they are, that completely open experience. Now, this is something I would like to share with you to really...  to give yourself the encouragement to find into a lightness, you know, light in the sense of not heavy in the sense, a lightness of fluidity. You might call it joy and happiness, but it's more about this flexibility, fluidity, lightness in times of distress. That's exactly what is needed. It's kind of a stammer practitioner. It's very important that  And yes, we say yes to the self-wing, yes, we don't fight it, and we don't indulge in it. In the now, we always have a second option, with more than two options. But basically we have the option to cling and not to cling. So yes, terror happens on us. Yes.  And do you want to stay with that? No, no, no. Love also happens on us. You want to stay with that? No. Go further. Never stay with just one perspective. Always remain open and connected to that what we call the source, the actual refuge. you  And this refuge is called Bodhi. This is like awakening. This is like where all our qualities awaken. And that's what we need to do in life and in dying. And the Buddhist tradition claims that there is no death. It just doesn't exist. There's no death. There's only continuity.  So if you want me to prepare you for death, I can only prepare you for continuity. It's no way to prepare you for death. That is too easy. There's no need to prepare for that. We can prepare for living or be loved ones. We can prepare for separation. We can prepare for entering new grounds, like going to a new country. Like for me, coming into Israel now, coming into a new country. I'm sorry.  You know, should I read lots of books about it? Should I get informed about the pro and cons of different opinions on the politics and the war and so on? No, no. How do I go? It's like living one place and entering a new. And what will serve me only my awareness? It's being there, being aware. Moving into  new situations, not so many upreories, you know, these kind of formed opinions by listening to others, but actually trusting that, you know, in German we say, if the heart is in the right spots, then you can manage our situations. Could that work for you? Some things similar in your own culture if you're really connected with your heart and that's...  It is for me this heart-filled wisdom, this awareness, it's not a wisdom of knowledge, it's just the presence, the fluidity and the willingness to respond. So with that, I mean, we can go everywhere. With this body or with another one or without body, whatever happens in the body and in the intermediate state, you know, we might live lots of that without body. We need to be prepared for...  or quickly changing situations and the best thing for that is fluidity. That's the best thing. Trying to hold onto opinions in the Bado is really stressful. You know, in the Bado and the intermediate state after death and we have left this body and the consciousness comes back to full awareness, then no one asks you your passport. You have now my identity.  Who cares if you were the woman, woman or a man? Who cares? There's no one there caring. You know, all these identities which we have, which we are so identified with. Oh, and they are so central to our existence now. They are meaningless afterwards. What counts is again, how you perceive the world, It's a tough flexible you're.  open and how much grasping there is because immediately the the the karmic cinema will project films to which you can grasp easily. The habitual patterns they can project all kinds of films. Horror and Heaven. Everything is possible. Now in both cases the advice would be stay relaxed. Stay relaxed. Stay connected. Take a neck to the neck.  to just being, being simple. So let's use these situations and the billions teachers saying that, let's use them now for a little bit of dying. Yes, let's use this moment of now to always let go a little bit of preoccupations, of identity. And that's exactly when the touchdown happens.  when we are not someone in particular anymore. You know, the way we experience the nature of mind is not different from one culture to the next, from a man to a woman, from a child to the grandmother. It's not different. We're talking about the same experience. Okay, so this was...  This was a little answer to these questions. It won't take away the fear of dying of death. Maybe it gives you the courage to face the fear. No. There is nothing you can lose when facing the fear.  goes straight into it and again you will discover space. Okay, as an encouragement, I tell you a story of one of my retreat cooks. I was guiding these retreats where everyone came together, 15 people, 15 men, on the other side there were the women. Three years, three months, three days, not leaving this courtyard with the 15 rooms. the 15 room.  here, no garden, pretty much no garden, that's very little, little bit of green. Only practice. From morning five o'clock to night 10, only practice. Meditation practice. All these retreats, they had two cooks. And the cooks were usually those who felt, hmm, I'm not at ease with practicing full time I want to be a half time practitioner and I want to  to serve. So I had this wonderful guy called Jerome, tattoos all over, really, you know, strong guy, French, French and the great cook. And since his childhood, every night, nightmare being persecuted, feared of dying, every night waking up, trembling and it continued into the retreat.  and he received this instruction, of course, to face the emotions, like a beginning to teach you, to face, to enter the experience. And in the second year of retreat, pretty much in the middle of the whole retreat, then he told us, I came to me and said, I have to tell you something. There was a night a few weeks ago.  When I turned around in the nightmare, in the nightmare when normally I've been running since childhood, I turned around and I faced the fear, I faced the danger. And there was nothing there. Since that night, the nightmare never returned. We have kept contact for some 10 years, And then I  lost contact, but just to tell you the power of when you really do it. So it won't help so much if I tell you, you know, it's easy to die and so on. All of this doesn't help when someone feels fear of dying. But the moment you will turn around, when it is the right time you will do it, then, actually then you can become fearless.  It has happened to me as well. There was a moment in my life when I thought I will die. And I could see, I could discover that fearlessness while looking into that fear, fear of drowning. Yes. It works for all emotions. There's no exception.  What we call an emotion with this in technical terms, a clich\u00e9. A clich\u00e9 is an affliction, it's something which narrows the mind. This is what I'm talking about, but it goes the same for the emotions which open the mind like love and generosity. Whatever movement of the mind is present when you look into it, nothing solid to be found. It was just movement and become...  Because now the movement is one of interest of looking into what was there before, that completely replaces all of what was there before. Has nothing left of the anger, of the pride, of the fear. Has nothing left. Because from the very beginning they never had any substance. And this is really what the Dharma is working with. And that's why you can say...  Dharma practice thrives on emotions. You can say the more thoughts, the more movements we have, the more we have to look into, and the more our insight can go. So, we will get back to that. This is just to be more precisely answering the question about the fear of death. This I cannot do for you. You will have to look into it for yourself.  I can only tell you that many have done it before you, and it was very relieving. I'm not saying that what comes after leaving this body is fine, you know, because this depends on our habitual tendencies. And then again we have to look into them. Now we're not to...  follow them, those egocentral ones. Let's meditate a little bit. It's always a good thing to do.  Thank you.  We continue like this morning. Remember, just one breath.  And if your mind wants to do more mindful breath, you know, wants to continue being aware, breathing in, breathing out. you  Then I invite you after a few breaths to tell to the mind, now is a pause. Please, don't try to go further.  When we go with the sensations, the experience of the in-breath, and the out-breath, this is called meditation with the focus, with the support. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to put it on.  And this instruction to make short sessions, only the duration of an in-breath or in-breath and out-breath is very much part of the Mahamudra tradition. It is confined in all the commentaries. It is an advice which  you can use to solve that question of right effort. How much actually is needed? And actually to come back into presence, only one mind movement is needed. You know that from the Vipersona teachings, you're very familiar with that probably, the moment you recognize that you are distracted, You are already back.  Yeah, that's the mind movement. That is a very common instruction. Now, that is very true. And yet, the effect is a little bit stronger if you come back with the help of the support. It's a little bit more than one mind movement. breathing in, breathing out, hit off.  already stabilizes the mind in the experience. And if then you let go of focusing on the support, you have the after effect. You have the after effect of having been focused for a moment, having been out of distraction. And the mind likes that. It takes.  a little while, a second or two or ten before it starts bubbling again. And it is this experience. How the minds is settled by itself, how it can be without having a focus, which we use in Mahamudra practice. It's the pause. And all the so-called pause is the actual interesting.  of the game. Because for as long as we are focusing, we are doing something with intention and there's not a complete letting go. It's difficult to forget ourselves while we do something. So it's always the pause that offers the possibility to forget ourselves, to forget all intent.  And then those who like coming from the pause, then you can play around with your mind and you start breathing in and breathing out as if it were still the pause. You know, you kind of keep that relaxation of the pause. To do whatever you want to do then. breathing in is just one of the possibilities.  So, it is like if we were to say it in our professional life, we would say, okay, watch how you are when you are invocation. And then when you go back to work, work as if you were invocation. Or it doesn't make sense? Oh, come on. I'm living my whole life like that. working right now you don't see it yes  and working, and it's very relaxed. So, the attitude is to, of course, we have to do things. And of course, I take care of a garden and I feel so many things to do at a publishing house and so on. You know, so many things. But the attitude is to do it as if you were on vacation. And that's how you will never enter both.  out because you are not taking yourself so seriously. There is this atmosphere of forgetting yourself a little bit or a lot, not taking yourself so seriously. Why doing what you need to do? I hope that makes that some point sense to you, really, at some point. Of course, here our patterns will always say you can't be always  on vacation, yes, yes, mom. But we also don't have to take life so serious all the time. We can tell mom that, you know, mom is enough of that. We can be more light. We can be we can be little bit less worried, less hope and fear, you know, little bit less of that. it would actually help us to...  even do a better job than before. We are so much better when we are relaxed. All our qualities that come forth when we are relaxed, when we are tense, you know, imagine I would be tense up here. I would be tense and trying to deliver a good talk. It wouldn't flow. I came with a completely different idea of what I was going to teach to you. If I had stuck to that idea, your experience and my...  presentation, they wouldn't have really met. You know, you would adapt, probably, would accept the presentation and take whatever goods you can take from it. But the meeting of minds which I'm hoping to continue would not happen if I stick to my procedure. I would have given a perfect outline of one Buddha and so on. This is not the spirit. Well, you get what I mean.  Yeah, it's the more important and life is to do things with quality. Whatever we do, we do it with quality. You know, when we take care of a plant, we water it, we water it in the right place. And we say, maybe hello to it. Yeah, we do it with quality. When we bake a bread, we make a good bread as good as we can. If you are not stressed, we will have...  This love for beauty will have this love for the details and we have the time for the details of whatever work we are doing. And then it will turn out good, it will turn out well. Whatever we are doing. And this is this attitude of the pause, the attitude of the pause entering the activity. We take the pause as an orientation.  of how to start the next activity. And because in the activity, we tend to become too focused. We need the next pause. For some of you, it would be very easy, for example, to train and to go for 100 very mindful breathing seconds and then you would  for 500. You would also manage that. And it would give some peace to your mind. But then, the next activity you do, are you going to be that focused again? Are you not kind of carrying some salad over into your Dharma practice and then from Dharma practice back to your daily activity to make your Dharma practice a success story like you wish to make your life.  the success story, this is not Dharma practice. This is only counting breath. You can count sesame seeds if you want. It's a difficult thing to do but you can try. What I'm going, why is sesame seeds is because actually it's peanuts. It's not what is giving enlightenment. on is stabilizing their mind, for that it is good.  but there are different ways of stabilizing the mind. Like doing a little bit of that, and then trusting the pause. Trusting this no effort, no body doing anything. And when you get distracted in  that, when that becomes the beginning of a new thought chain and some back to the simple focus, whatever focus you want to take. You can move through the body, on back to the body sensations, else where you don't need to have the breath, focus on the visual object, can do a mantra, all of that is possible. do what is necessary.  And then trust the mind to stay in that openness in the past. And when you begin to observe what happens in the past, then you can see, and this is an additional quality to mindfulness. It's we call it often conscientiousness.  But it's also called rakefulness. It's different terms are being used for that. In the pause, you can notice the stirring of your kamik impulses to engage with something. You can notice, before you start thinking, you feel the impulse to think. you  Buddha called this the first to think. We have heard about this, Tanya, yes, it's the first. The first to move into relationship with objects. And this the first to think, we can relax that. And the best to relax it is in the past, because nothing else is happening. It's easy to notice.  You know, I'm sitting and meditation, and then I hear the sound. And then it's very easy to notice how I want to open the eyes and see what the sound is. Yes. And it's in the same way I'm sitting. I'm focused. Well, I'm focused. I don't notice the wish to focus. I don't notice the wish to entertain a dualist.  connection with the world. I don't notice that because I'm actually doing it. When I stop, there is this unbearable openness. And help, I need an object. You know, is like calming immediately. You know, it's like after a short while for those who are not trained, comes the empires to have the next start to focus.  on the next bird which is chirping to whatever fear the body because we are getting uncomfortable being without a support, being without a focus, being without a dualistic relationship. This is the precursor, this thirst to think is the precursor of the fear to die. This is, you know, because this experience of being nobody.  in relation to nothing else is very close to dying. It is very close to the experience of having normal reference points. And it makes us uncomfortable. I haven't seen it in this group so much. But often when we are going to deeper meditation practices and people start relaxing, when they really let go of control, and then meditate, let go of control.  And then suddenly comes a jerk. You know, it's a jerk in the middle of meditation. They don't know where it comes from. It is this control mechanism that wants to get back into a more structured connection with the world. A more structured me. I'm losing myself, but this is making something deep inside afraid. They don't even notice the emotion. They only notice the jerk. Maybe you have had...  that's already in your practice. I see, at least one person was nodding, so the second person was nodding, so that's very nice. Some of you can connect with that because this is so to speak, the self-defense, the self-defense of our dualistic world, or dualistic perception. by habit. And this is where we need  to relax more. Not more deeper, but this area, and where these impulses come that want to go back into the usual and dualistic fixation, in that area where these impulses come, that's where meditation needs to stay. We need to stay a little bit there, becoming familiar with the degree of...  relaxation that normally would put us asleep. Normally we would fall asleep because we don't usually experience that degree of relaxation by being awake. You know when we fall asleep, we have to give up all concern for whatever bothered us during the day, we have to get out of self-concent, otherwise we can't sleep because it keeps on going. Now to relax that, then usually...  we go through this wonderful, nobody moment and then we touch sleep. Now, Mahmouda is to relax exactly like that, like we go to sleep exactly that relaxation and we relax into wakefulness, into complete presence, not into a sleep. But the very excitation is the same.  The non-identification is the same. And you can do it because you all have slept at certain times in your life, you were all able to sleep. And hopefully even tonight. So you know how to do that. And now we have to work on that mechanism that relaxation means going to sleep. That's why so many of you get drowsy when we do this relaxed meditations. you wouldn't get  So, it's a draw Z, if we were doing effort-oriented meditations. If I give you a task to do, well, some as a means of protection would also go draw Z, but the others they would be able to do that they would feel much more alive. You know, as soon as you have something to do, have a task, we stay on the task, we can do it. Like those of you who, the moment you start reading at night, you know, the book is interesting, you can go for it.  hours, you don't sleep because you just stay here. Some of you have learned to relax and fall asleep on the book. It's the book. Yes, but I'm of the type, when I get an interesting novel or something, then I will go and to four o'clock in the morning or something. It stimulates the mind. And this is what we do with our thirst to think, As pause, relax.  And this relaxation is uncomfortable if sleep is not following. If there is no sleep following, then this relaxation becomes a feeling of being disoriented, of not knowing who I am, whether I exist. That's why the card came up with this famous sentence. You know? You don't know the handles better.  I will go to Ergussum, you understand, huh? It's like, I think, therefor I exist. And this mechanism that he found out is not a proof for existence, it just a proof for what is samsara. When I think...  I feel that I exist. And this is exactly the mechanism we have to do with. That we move into thinking processes when we feel in danger, then there's a certain question arising whether I exist. And this is the existential fear. This is the Buddha called this the undercurrent of some Sala. on the other carlens.  the wish to exist. Like it can shift when existence is not so nice, it can shift into wishing not to exist. And it is basically related to the wish to have sensory contact. Thinking is only one of the forms of sensory contact. Every sensory contact helps me to affirm my existence. Okay, so he don't work look on the  So you get now what we are doing at meditation, focus, pause and in the pause when you get used to it. the beginning of your position. When you get used to those poses, you can feel the inner dry.  before the distraction even starts and that drive to affirm existence, to affirm my being with yet another thought process, yet another sensory contact. This drive we relax. That is where Mahmoudra practice really works. That is the additional thing you will there can offer to you. Okay.  Can you only nine minutes more than this one? So in I'm the eatin' time-jazzin'  I need to be in the hands of my friends I can't go on a trip I long to my ears I can't sleep on the water I can't sleep on a trip I can't sleep on a trip I can't sleep on a trip and get one big  I'm  You",
    "12.mp3": " So I'm very happy to sit with you again for a little Sangha meeting you could say with questions and answers. Now I do have a stalk of questions here, but I do feel much more interesting. Even those who have written me these notes, if you could speak up and say the question because then I understand you much better. I have difficulties to know really what is meant Let's just...  these few sentences. So, feel free to speak up and I'm happy to answer or to share whatever is necessary. Please, you can help me with all the different ones. She was the first.  This essence that I have been talking about, also another question here was about the Source, to tap into the Source. And then what is this? Is this consciousness and what happens when...  awareness meets with it. Yes, this is your question. Here we have the finger pointing to the Moon and the finger is not the Moon. This image of the essence does not mean that there is something to be found. We are here.  we are talking about consciousness, we are talking about mind. It is not something else than awareness or mind. And actually, that which we call the source or the nature or essence of mind is the same mind as now when it is not producing any clouds, any veils, no curtains, nothing which veils the direct  perception. And this, this open awareness, without those clouds, is actually not an empty space, it is a dynamic space full with quality. So in that awareness, naturally love generosity and so on, these qualities. They are naturally there. When there is something in the system,  your age that would invite them, and naturally they are there because there's nothing which hinders them. So it's like the ground potential of our mind, this different main names for that. Are you any further with your question now? Did it help? Yes, okay. Then please, Lila, I hope you made to see who is the next one.  I want to ask something about the medication instruction. It may be, maybe you can get it right. Like in the beginning I start creating the spaciousness and the very wide perspective as an add-through but also as an adaptation. And then when you add reading, so it becomes funny like the...  So, the breathing almost doesn't exist. Very, very gently. I repeat quickly for the other. So, the question is about the spaciousness and the relationship with breathing. How we do the meditation? And you have the feeling that when the breathing comes in, that this is much more gross than the spaciousness and which there is hardly any notice. Notice  of breathing, and breathing is unimportant in that spaciousness. Yes, it means that it's too different from the snake. So this is a wonderful question to talk about yet another speciality of this approach. The speciality of this approach is to bring together spaciousness and precision. Because just one, you cannot handle the world.  be active in the world. To be active in the world, you have to be precise. You know this from your job, from whatever you are doing, from talking with people, one has to be precise. Every word is important and even when you make a nice flower arrangement, there is precision in that arrangement and when you cook and so on. So there is a need for precision and in that precision we could get lost because we are often too...  much glued in the fixation, the precision becomes the fixation. So we learn to be precise, like precisely reaching out to touch, very precisely with a light touch with a spacious mind. To say words, to you, to answer to your question where the mind remains spacious. So this is the bringing together of this spaciousness and the breath. The breath is...  just an example of precision. So when you think it is too gross, actually then I invite you to discover the most subtle aspects of breathing. And then you will come deeper and deeper and you will see that then what we call the dynamic of mind is very similar to breathing. There is a sensitivity which is similar to the inverse and there's a creativity with it.  which is similar to the outbreath, it says, if you were watching in the breathing process, you watch the arising and passing on of whole worlds. Yeah, it becomes very subtle and universal. And this is due to connecting spaciousness with the simple method of breathing. So this is where there is a big difference, maybe to what you have learned so far. The breath was...  maybe just an anchor for mindfulness and you didn't go so deep with that. And it's typical for Mahmouda that whatever we take as a meditation object, we will always take it in the most subtle and also symbolic sense. We go into the depths of what is possible there to discover that. So for example, I've used this example before but I make it more because interesting spaciousness.  I will ask you to meditate on a flower bouquet. Here's here. And first it seems to be just an ordinary flower bouquet. But then I will ask you to meditate on the spaces where you can see through the flowers. You see the flowers and you see the space. Then to meditate the flowers with the spaces in between and the spaces around. So you have spaciousness in your awareness and you have the  Then you will see that, then I would ask you to close the eyes and to see the flowers in your mind. And then to look into that after image of the flowers and to see it's like a rainbow. And then to open the eyes and to become aware of the seeing process. actually at the same time as that is the seeing of something seemingly solid it to see what I'm doing.  like experience. So we would go like that. We would always combine the spaces, aspect with the precision and see how the two finally work together. And for activity it is very important because activity in this world means in order to be helpful in this world we always need to remain as open as possible and then as  This precise, with the loving awareness, completely precise and what we are doing. So we need to bring them together. And this is the little exercise that we shared. It's one of the examples. You will do the same with walking. You probably are familiar with walking meditation. Now, in the walking, it's not only the precision of feeling your souls and feeling the changes of equilibrium.  through your whole body, it's not only being aware of the breathing, but actually you are moving in space. There is space so to speak flowing around you. Then you begin to notice how you are working, and while working, actually the experience of walking itself happens in that spacious dimension of mind. So you begin to not be so much  the walking itself, but how the walking is perceived and whether there is someone walking and not. So like this we could continue with all the examples of life. It's always a question of spaciousness which means non-clinging, non-fixation, together with the necessary position to perform a task.  There's a more coming, you will try. You will try. I think it is good. That's good. You can come back on me later on if you want.  You want to get into that pause when doing the breathing, yes. This is because you have been practicing breathing meditation.  much that that is the habit of still continuing with the breathing awareness. And this is okay. In the pause, you are allowed to still notice the breath. Just you don't emphasize it, but it continues by habit. And it's a wonderful thing that the mind continues by itself resting on the breast, settling in there. So it is already apart.  of the voluntary meditation. It becomes now a meditation that happens by itself. So this is already that pause you found. You just thought that the object of meditation, the breath, should disappear in the pause. No, it doesn't have to disappear. It can continue. Now the other part is of course it's possible to go away from the breathing.  And for you, in order to do that, when you sit at home, for example, at your meditation place, do some practicing on the breathing, and then when you want to make a pause, look out of the window into the sky. It is a slight changing of object, but you don't meditate on the sky. It is just pause. and a slight shift of attention.  and this makes it easier for you to feel the pause. And this movement is actually something which we need to learn in meditation. We concentrate on something. Here's the breathing, I imitate the breathing. And then we don't focus anymore. And it is this movement that we learn. It is, okay, job is done, leave it.  And we learn to make this move, and in the beginning, to just do this move when it's a little bit difficult, we need a different object. We need something to direct it to. So we let go here. And before we cling there, we say, not necessarily, but not it's for clinging. But because we shift, and especially if it is just open sky, then there is not much clinging involved. so that's an easy one.  like this you can find your way into the pause. Good big chapter, I repeat for everybody. How do you practice when you are caught by intense emotion? Hmm, do I take time?  that? Yes please? Okay. The first step is the pause. That's the step we already talked about. The first step when you have an emotion like would you give me an example? Should take angle or some other emotion what would be your would you like an example?  It could be a fear or anger. I take anger, it's a little bit more, it's easier to grasp, it's a little bit easier for the example to be understood. So, I'm angry. I'm angry. You know, all the anger is rising in me and I want to speak. Speak, I want to shout, I want to...  hit whatever the anger wants to do then I want the basic idea of anger is wants to destroy its object wants to finish with it yeah that's basically the intention and now this is going to do more harm than good so there is a motivation now I don't want to follow the anger this motivation is telling me wait don't speak now this can create a lot of harm it can.  destroy the friendship, it can, you know, don't hit, don't do anything, you know, this is what I think in every culture we say take 3D breath before saying something. Yeah, it's this kind of... You know, like, okay, and this pause, no matter how you created, sometimes it's really so intense as that that you... So someone like holds onto the table.  now in order not to say something, can be as intense as that or it can be at pause, which the others don't notice. And the pause you can create it a little bit like I said to our sister here before. You can create it by directing for the time being quickly your attention to something else. So the breath would be one, one like this, but you can also just hold on to looking at the flowers.  or you help yourself to not react, because this is angry reaction which is about to happen. And this pause enables the second step. In that pause, you have a little moment you know, to feel what could be helpful now. What can help me?  What can help me and what can help the situation? This is what we need to pause for For example one thing that could help me because I'm like I I Don't know the way myself is like SOS Buddha's please Please help me, you know what can help here? You know like a little prayer of desperation, you know completely desperate And this is what it directs.  our mind already to the refuge, to what we have confidence in. Or what will help me? For example, you have a fight with your partner, maybe you have children, I'm only inventing, I know nothing about you. Say, you think of your children. For my children, I won't fight now. You know, it's like the love for your children, which gives you then more energy to work with the emotion. and within the  remedies that help us to work with the emotions, that are some which are very, very capable of transforming our way of seeing the situation. For example, you get angry at a person, that person is really behaving in a stupid way. And then one of the famous remedies is seeing how that person is caught in his own  her own emotions. Just this thought, this, if that can come in in the pose, the other person is just as stuck as myself, you know, to realize that, that the other person is not free, is not acting out of free will, but actually is acting out of a whole lot of emotional patterns, which make this person behave so arrogant, behave so whatever. A quick shift and...  to see how unfree that person is, a quick realization of, okay, if I just anger against anger, anger against pride, it won't work, yeah? And then this would be in this whole realm of the remedies, the second step, the also sometimes called antidotes, there are many different remedies that we can use. for example just to continue breathing as always.  So one of the remedies, just to continue staying on the breath, not suppressing the anger, but breathing with the anger. And then, by the nature of that, because part of your attention is on the breathing, the anger will change, it will evolve, and new way of seeing things with a wise mindset. There's many things to be said about that. And then there comes the third step, the third step is actually...  A completely different view of the situation. A classical one is, so angry, what do I need to learn from this situation? Instead of pushing the undesired away, we say, Antibed Tradition, wow, the lama has come to visit. visit. The guru has come for the visit. That's a wonderful situation.  to learn because that emotion is now the guru. Here is what I need to learn from. So big guru visiting. Here's heavy. The meaning of the word guru in Sanskrit is someone with a heavy weight. Someone was, yeah, and heavy blessing. And you know, this is like that which makes me angry. The guru is visiting. So taking the difficulty as the path. That's actually the...  shift on the third level of working with emotions. And then we have of course due to these previous three steps, pause, remedy and shift of vision, there's much more space. We become scared and we have that space which enables the four step which is looking into the emotion itself. Now a trained practitioner  perhaps look immediately because of having looked so often than even when the situation arises that makes me angry because of the habit of looking into the mental movements I might look directly. But most practitioners they will do that at home. They have mastered the situation in their business life for example on the street wherever they were they have mastered that that was the other tech.  and when you have the moment to meditate at home, you bring the situation back to your awareness, back to your meditation, and you try to feel that emotion that was the strongest in the situation. For example, the anger. And you can feel the anger arising when you think of the situation again. And then at that moment you turn towards  the anger and you try to look where is the center of that anger, that where you feel it's strongest. And then you make the surprising discovery of no substance, nothing substantial to be found. And this is the liberating experience of realizing the nature of the emotion. That's a Vipassana moment. And that's the moment of knowing the nature of what's happening. then in this  So far, these four steps, they are a summary of seven steps, which the Buddha explained of how to deal with emotions, but they are a summary of these seven. Tibetan or let's say the Tantrik tradition, the Mahmouda tradition, added a fifth step, which is called taking the emotions as a path, which means once you have realized The  age of emotion several times, then you go into situations which provoke that emotion. So you search, you look for them. You go into challenging situations, you're not waiting until karma produces, you know, at some point the next situation to work with, you go into situations where they arise quickly because  they're so challenging. So this is an enhancing the process of realization, of purification, of karma through realization. That would be the fifth step. So these five steps, they were in that form written down by Kamar Chakme Rinpoche, famous Lama of I think the 19th century in the letter in the letter to Alam.  who was in retreat and who had that question, you know, I'm practicing very well and doing my practice since many years with Buddha, Tita and so on, but there is always some aspect of dealing with the emotions which I cannot handle. And in answer to that letter, because Kamachakme was in retreat himself, he wrote a letter explaining these five steps, which he called the peacock. The peacock.  as a symbol of a bird who can eat grains that are in digest for other birds, for other creatures, and develops these beautiful colors, you know, these rainbow-like colors of the feathers of the rainbow. So the peacock has become a symbol in Indian Buddhism for the capacity to use the mental poisons, the mind poisons.  in order to develop the beauty of awakening. Okay, so if you search for Kameh Chakmeh, actually my colleague, Andi Laryun Sumpam, was she translated that letter into the teaching of Gennadun Phrichir on that text into English. I think it's simply called working with emotions, looking to internet working with emotions.  If you see any reference, any Lardinjian Paramo or Karma Chakme Rampurji, that should be the text, maybe you can find it. You decide. Yes. That's it.  always good that's the pause Oh yes, oh yes, there are your friends They are on the same road with us  Okay, I will follow the direction of your finger. Go ahead.  Go ahead, yes, I will try to look. Transition.  You are a social worker and you are looking for the transition from the sense of self to a feeling for others. You fear. Yes, it's broken. It's still there but it's damaged. you  Your vessel cannot hold. Yes, yes, I will help you not to believe it. Yes. I am asking you to, when I am not, Good, to take it home.  I'm looking at the lips maybe a little. How to feel about the view of the heart. Here last one, we talked a lot about reflecting seriously when you're a servant, teacher.  I don't know how you call it. So, since it comes through here, you know, how do you sometimes get connected so strongly, so deeply, so how do you, how do you take care of them? It's a boundary.  How do you take care of the boundaries when so many impressions come through? And you feel so much going on around you and actually what's going on around you is going on inside of you. It is not safe. Inside the situation, the helicopter is just a helicopter feeling it.  It's not so complicated. You're not the only one feeling that. So first we need to take care of ourselves. That's the first thing. And that's why I like so much that you also work with a focus, the support for meditation.  that you feel your body, you feel the breathing sensations. You develop a good presence with shamata. And this is, there's no need to establish more of a boundary than that. The shamata on the physical sensations on the breathing, or even on an outer object, visual object or something. This already set its mind.  in that simple presence of now. And you don't go for spaciousness at that moment. You go for more precision. You want to feel precisely and stay there. You don't use your antenna to cause spaciousness and feeling the others. They are so close to each other that you first you need the grounding of, you know, mother earth, walking meditation.  the earth and your body, yes, and then you then you stabilize that. Okay, and when you feel stable and that's what you need actually to do every day, every evening when you come home as a social worker you need to do that, you need to take care of yourself. And it's very important to balance because your heart seems to go out very easily to others, seemed to feel a lot.  maybe not everyone feels so much like you, so you might feel very overwhelmed by a lot alone.  Okay, I can't continue. Okay? Maybe you find some nuggets in there. Okay? So, with our sensitivity, we need to learn to Have  and let's sort of speak to, to manage it well. As human beings, we are so sensitive. If we were to live our full sensitivity, without wisdom, it would constantly overwhelm us. Now, especially when you have been traumatized, and they have been traumatized in your childhood, in your everyday experience, Then...  The boundaries are even weaker. And there's a lot of fear, and yet there's this heightened sensitivity. There's so much learning to do. And here we need to do all the stabilizing aspects of meditation. Stabilizing means clear focus, not too long, not overdoing it, and a lot of attention to oneself. So really good taking care of yourself.  So this is where all these meditation full with kindness and self acceptance come into whatever we feel, including, and that's one of the very current feelings, including the feeling of helplessness. the helplessness, the not being able to change the situations which we feel.  is some of the most distressing emotions in this world. To be able to accept oneself in this helpless situation, where one really wants things to go differently, one feeds so much with everyone in the situation and right now one can hardly do anything, and they say hardly. Because this is where the wisdom comes in. Another...  are not to feel overwhelmed. Without stepping out and trying to save the world, we can at least make wishes. We can at least, and that's where the force of mantra is so powerful, because you don't even think about the wish that you do. You just do omtada to tada to the sore. Or the shorter one, ommani, patmehung, ommani, pehmehung, usually pronounced. a mantra of compassion, mate.  everyone awake and you can say it in your language, may everyone be free of suffering. You can do these metaphors, may everyone be happy and have the causes of happiness, where everyone be free of suffering. So you turn the confusion which you feel and the helplessness, you turn it into a wish. And this is like allowing your heart to breathe again, because now it can express itself. Otherwise it...  gets stuck. We feel so much, we are overwhelmed, there is a feeling of helplessness, blockage. And the blockage makes the heart go crazy. But only closed in, some of them they feel like they cannot feel their heart anymore, but this is the protection from having failed too much. Actually, we are still very sensitive. The vessel never breaks. We will talk about that later you can still  feel, but in order to feel all of that you need to know how to give expression to that care that you wish to offer to the world. Human beings are by nature very caring. They want to have others who are hungry, who are thirsty, who are in pain. It's natural to have them. with this.  This empire is blocked, we are suffering even more. As a social worker, you are constantly faced with situations where you would like to have much more than what you can. So this is the first thing. Look that you can find a prayer, something that expresses the emotion in your heart. when you see a Tibetan watching TV and they are on the  understand what's going on because many of them they speak English nowadays. They understand all the news, but they have the mala and the hand, or money, pay more, or money. They see the last tornado, they see the war here and there, or money, pay more, or money, pay more. And immediately there is a release of the tension of those news coming in and it's transported into a wish for all of humanity. It's into a non-sectarian wish for everyone.  concerned. So there is an immediate release of that tension and you see that the mala which lies normally on the anchor, when the situation becomes intense, the hands goes up to the heart and they are they are reciting here because it's really very much with the heart energy that we need to communicate. And then you You'll find other ways. It's not the last thing. Then you then your creative  find small ways to speak, to contemplate, to help. This is what you have learned as a social worker. And then I want to talk a little bit about this vessel, this receptacle. Vessel is another word for receptacle. And actually this is even used in the teachings to become a good vessel to.  hold to the teachings and not to be broken, leaking, having holes, being rusty, being muddy, like a pure vessel. Now, we become a pure vessel, a vessel that can hold the experiences of this world, if we are not leaking. And this is the translation of  and Sanskrit words which are indicating this stretch. So in order to be able to hold the experience of this world better, we need to take care that our mind doesn't leak in the sense of always going off. This film and that chat and this and this and these news and so on. This is a shamater part. We need to stabilize the mind.  Not moving like in an escape mode, in the flight mode, to all kinds of objects to distract oneself. And this is very difficult for people under stress. When I get under stress, the tendency to go for something which distracts me is bigger than when I'm not under stress. So this is where the safe care comes in when you feel  that difficult to hold my life. I feel like I'm flowing in all directions and sometimes exploding and sometimes feeling quite dead and I don't have the energy anymore. This is the time to not do anything. You have to stop all the gadgets you have, no smartphones, TV, you know, just relaxing wherever you can, maybe leaning against.  the tree and it might take hours, days, weeks and months that you have to find yourself back. You need to really take good care. Most of us we just have half an hour in the evening maybe and then maybe half an hour in the morning but take more if you can. Squeeze out from your life, these precious.  hours of not doing anything, of not being preoccupied with any distraction. And that in that safe space where you're not doing anything, this is where you begin to feel yourself. This is where you begin to drink from the source, as I was saying, you begin to feel your resources. you feel that this overburdened mind that was...  incapable yesterday night to love anybody. You know, this mind is relaxing now. And having some warm feelings for that little fly at the window, so I feel motivated to open the window. A little warm feeling there, just to let the fly fly out. else is like you're very, very slowly, very slowly this  science of your true nature, they will manifest again. And they need so much patience. And of course we know the life is very speedy. So in this speedy life you need to find those moments of doing nothing, no task, no demands, no interaction. Taking care of this very sensitive you  so that again your antenna can move out, you can feel yourself and you begin to feel others again. There's no way around that. Yes, when you know the path it goes a little bit quicker, but it's not like you can't just snip your fingers and your back and fore resonance. It's not how it does go like that. Never ever.  You have to take your time, don't try to meditate too much, don't give yourself another task, but let your meditation be to trust the world that it will not break down as you lean against it. You know, just that. At least the world right now is trustworthy for the moment. Okay, for the moment. the tree, whatever. Drank a sip of...  of water, okay, there is still water here, you know, like if you have really to the basics and this is how we are human beings, we need stability, security, we need something to drink, we need something to eat and we need love, we need them, the next movement will be that we move towards a person where we trust also the way we are together, the communication and so you...  And also there we don't do much. It's not that we are going to see a film together. It's too much, it's too much. Just being, just being. And this is something we need to learn, to just be together. Both of us, relaxing from the demands of the world, but already feeling each other in the common path of relaxing with the ways to feel.  find back the energy to open up to the world again. Because many of you have professions where you're in a very social way trying to give a good input into society. So we all need that energy. And the source is always there, but it's kind of a source which waits for us, and which open.  up when we have the patience to sit next to it. It's not like, okay, I need to drink from the source, so let me have a sip of water and to continue. It's not like that, we relax into the source, we relax into that Ground nature of our being, we are going through all the steps of feeling the The exhaust, the hair, the...  and then a little moment of clarity and then maybe they need to sleep and then more clarity and then maybe they need to drink something and then you know when you really exhaust it you can feel all these different steps of how you come closer to the source and then there There will be moments when you know...  Now I'm connected again. That's it. Now I'm back to normal, so to speak. And this normal, natural self. And don't then jump up too quickly to immediately do something, but stay a little bit longer. Take a bath and then go. Oh. Now you turn it over. Oh yeah, it's the food, it's the crocs now  We have to be respectful with the cooks and all the team. So, last question. Oh, she's a good singer, yes. Deva.  The question is about frustration. I first said you can find this mantra, maybe you can put it on the board, the name so that that everyone can then find it on the Internet. You can find beautiful other man.  as well, but the same singer, there's different singers, but she is one of the best ones. And so she would put it on the board and then the question is about frustration. What to do when you don't get what you wish for over a long period of time? Then you have to find out is it important or not? It's very important. Then you have to get out of the situation where this  very important wish is not fulfilled. If you can't, what is only the other option is to let go of the wish. If it is very important for me, for example, the very important wish in my life, to give an easier example is to bring together the path of healing and the path of awakening. so I needed I had this as the strongest wish in my mind.  And I searched and medicine didn't find it there, and therapy didn't find it there, in home operative. All, there were always limits, yes, and then the Dharma is this fulfillment of that wish, which is really the very important wish in my life. I did give up the wish to have children, for example. You don't seem to need to give that up. It is  But yes, there were wishes, very important wishes, that was the wish while I married, that's why we married. But we both wanted to practice more, and the children had to wait, and at a certain time we had to give up. I had to give up country, I had to give up my sangha for other more important wishes. Then you move on, if you can. the  yet? Not quite. Are there normally there's more than two options, right? The option to give it up or to go to where it can be fulfilled. Is that a third one? Is that maybe the third possibility to fulfill the wish yourself, to go towards the wish fulfilling mind inside of yourself and without changing the situation to find the fulfillment by going to the source. you  That is very demanding, but it's always possible. You can realize awakening in the middle of a prison. It's possible, just to give them far out example.",
    "13.mp3": " The Mahamudra Path, as you have heard already, takes the experience of a Buddha as a guideline. It is a path for the Buddhist Satvas. And it is quite important to understand.  How a Buddha is able to teach? How is a Buddha able to communicate? In a word where all around, there is confusion, there is clinging. Does the Buddha fall into clinging himself? Does he need to cling a little bit at least in order to understand the questions that are being put to him?  There was a little bit of discussion going on in the past centuries about that. And I would like to present you a wonderful summary of how the major emotions, how they, when they dissolve, when they liberate the energy, how they give...  rise to different aspects of that timeless awareness, that primordial awareness that we call the Buddha awareness, the awakened mind. It is important to understand what bodhichitta really means. What is the mind of awakening? What is it if we need to be able to describe it at least a little bit. It is more than just  to four immeasurabhars, to four Brahma-vihadas. They are of course there. But in a way that a Buddha would never say, oh, I feel love for you. You know, it's like the Buddha doesn't feel love, doesn't feel compassion. But it's not, no, it's just that everything that obstructs the love, everything that abstracts.  compassion, that means being able to feel others, this is gone and it's completely natural to feel and to be supportive and so on. There is no sentiment of love and compassion and there's no one practicing equanimity. Since the Buddha sees through all phenomena, there is no need to practice the quantity is simply the result of the scene.  And the love is the result of no more ego-clinging, same for the compassion. And the joy is to result, you can say this modeta, the joy is the result of two processes. One is no more jealousy, no more comparison. So rejoicing in the qualities of others is natural. You know, because there's no...  obstacle to feeling joy when something wholesome happens on the world. And the other sense of joy is simply because there's no Madukha in the mind of a Buddha, then of course there is joy. But maybe a better word is serenity. The mind is serene. This means this is not an exuberant joy. It is not an joy that the Buddha would say, Oh today I'm very joyful. Well no, this is...  All these conditioned experiences of love, compassion, joy, equanimity, the conditioned aspect is not present in a Buddha's mind. Yes? So let's go through slowly, a classical presentation in the Mahamudra of the five aspects of timeless awareness. Sometimes called the five wisdoms. and imagine you have  a lotus flower with four petals and a center. The center is the circle and then you have these four petals and four falling. So you know that the lotus is very often used to symbolize Buddha mind, right? It's one of the old symbols of the Buddhist tradition is the lotus. The lotus growing out of the mud, unstained by the muddy water, completely pure, a miracle of nature.  how is that possible? Just below the Lotus is the muddy water, and that's what the Lotus has grown in and comes out, and then there is the unfolding of the immaculate beautiful petals of a Lotus flower. And this is a metaphor, a simile to understand and how our own mind works.  What happens to us when we truly purify the mud? What is it made of? Glacier, sir? Clear. So desire, anger, pride, jealousy, ignorance, fear, you know, the ingredients of the samsariq soup. Then also, all the time already signs that there is something else.  This is not your whole story. There's always love, compassion, there's always joy, there is, especially for us humans, we have this splendid mixture of just enough suffering to grow and enough of the qualities to not lose courage. Yes? So we have this mixture and there's, there are always signs of friendship, there's always signs of warmth. As if the pure Buddha nature We are already shimmering through. Shimmering through.  through the other, quite cloudy experiences. And now if you take the center of the Lotus, you know what's the central problem of some Sada? The central problem is the so-called ignorance. Our Vija and Sanskrit means absence of understanding, absence of awareness. video is another word for annoying.  awareness. So this ignorance makes us then believe in the true existence of a core of the experience, the so-called subject, the experience, the me. And from the feeling of me separated from the other, then all the other emotions arise, all all the other aspects of our subsets.  Mandala, their advice. Me and the Sender and what I desire, the object, agreeable object which I like, which I want to have. Me and that which I don't like, the disagreeable object, aversion, anger. Me and my tendency to compare, and if I compare myself to someone who is better, who has more...  If you jealousy, envy, rivalry, if I compare myself to someone who is not so capable as myself, not so rich and so on, then I feel pride. So basically we have a Lotus in the center. This is now I'm describing now the Mandala of Samsara, the Samsatic world that we live in. of our subsiding world. There is this incredible...  believe in a Self, where no Self is to be found, but we still believe it. We are convinced and we are very much afraid when it is being touched. So the proof is our fear actually, that this belief is there. We think something can happen to me. And that's the sign. And all the ignorance is only finished, is overcome when that natural fearlessness  arises of normal clinging to the Self. A Buddha doesn't need to practice courage, huh? No need for courage. Courage is only for those who have fear. The Buddha is not courageous, he is simply fearless. Because beyond that fear of dying, beyond that fear of criticism, beyond the fear of public opinion, because you know all these fears that normally drive us. So this is the  and the central ignorance uses two mechanisms. One is the mechanism of liking and disliking, that is the mechanism of desire aversion. And the other mechanism is comparing. Comparing is me and the other, better or worse. worse and then we fall into jealousy and pride.  It's like two basic mechanisms which make Samsara operate in us. And the central axis, the point where they meet is the ignorance. The ignorance is the central hub you can say of turning the wheel of Samsara. without ignorance or the others cannot work.  It is this lack of awareness. So all our meditation is directed to developing more and more awareness of how it is. Sometimes we move into the various emotions and we deal directly with them, but often, especially in inside meditation, we try to directly go towards discovering whether or not there is a safe in what we experience.  whether or not something solid can be found. Because this ignorance also tries to deny change, fluidity, impermanence, tries to deny consequences of actions, and so on. There is a lot of the activity of ignorance, enormous. And it makes us believe that if we could only get what is so nice, Nice, that we would.  happy. If he could only drive out the enemies, then we would be so happy. If he could only be like him or her, then we would be so happy. Now this is the envy and pride issue. All of that is illusion. All of that shows that when we get what we were looking for, it is only a temporary happiness. It's on his short time.  And now we go the path of practice. We imagine that all of us, big family, we practice and practice and practice. And we begin to look through. And I will explain you a little bit how that could be understood what happens in the mind of a Buddha. When you look through this center belief in a self,  if you see, wow, nothing to be found. That is the moment where you enter that absolute spacious awareness, which we call Dharma Dato, the sphere of all phenomena. There is no more center. It is central is awareness. So the center of the Lotus is central is awareness. Okay, there is no center. just space in this.  We call this the Dhamma D\u0101tu awareness, the Dhamma D\u0101tu wisdom. The wisdom, the understanding of the spacious quality of our experience. Okay, this is like this sky. It's like the best example is like this sky. And then...  due to not clinging to a self, then what happens when anger dissolves? There's also a wisdom arising when anger dissolves. There's also another aspect of awareness, which becomes very, very clear. And it is the fluidity. Anger is of all the emotions.  anger hatred is the one emotion which blocks the mind most. The mind gets completely blocked and anger. You know, so blocked that sometimes we can have only tunnel vision. You know, it's like we black out. It's like so blocked. Yes. Now what we discover as anger aversion deserves is that the fluidity of our natural mind comes back. And that's...  like the water element. And it is being called in the tradition it is called mirror like awareness. Because in the old times when there were no glass mirrors then the surface of the water of the steel water was the place where you could see into the mirror. And the water only becomes still when there is no aversion and a mind. Yes, and the aversion.  finished, then the mind shows its peace for nature and it becomes so clear because of the fluidity. You see water as this capacity of cohesion and this is the quality of mind to be fluid and that also in a Buddha mind all experiences connect as a  complete cohesion. There is no non-consciousness in the consciousness. The awareness flows on, and is at the same time as spacious as this guy. So this continuity of an awareness, which flows on from situation to situation completely unhindered. This is called the mirror-like aspect of awareness.  And it flows on into all the different situations. And when there is no more comparing, when there is no more comparing was better and was misopera, euantheria, meantheria, usopera and so all of this, when phenomena are seen and there one taste of the end.  nature of what they truly are without substance, then it is this awareness of the equality of all phenomena which arises. This is the third one. We are moving now and Pride has deserved. There's no more someone comparing himself or herself to the rest of the world. And there is the equality of all sentient beings which is a natural...  experience to the Buddha, there is no one better or worse, himself included or herself included. And this equality also includes all other experiences. They are all seen in their equally ungraceful nature. So that is the aspect of equality. And this equality is likened to the earth among the earth.  Now the first one was the space, the second one was like the water, this one is like the earth. Because the empty nature of all phenomena, the ungrasp of the nature of all phenomena is completely reliable. We can rely on that, as reliable as the earth is carrying us. That is why the earth is being used as an example. and the Earth carries everybody.  without making a difference. The earth is equanimous in itself. Everyone can walk on it, whether good or bad, small or great, you know, does matter. All of everyone is welcome on Mother Earth. And this Earth example is pointing to the fact that in the mind of an awakened being not only the mind is spacious, Not only it is fluid.  But there is a constant knowing of the one taste of our phenomena, the insubstantial quality of everything that is experienced. That is what the Buddha always knows. He doesn't need to remind himself. He doesn't need to practice to remind himself. It is just naturally, it is as natural for the Buddha to be in that quality of knowing, is nowadays for us to...  know that a rainbow is a rainbow and we cannot grasp a rainbow. Because we have grown up, we have become adults. Now maybe as a child we ran after the rainbow and we tried to catch it, but we won't do it anymore. We know a rainbow is just a reflection in this sky due to a conditioned phenomena. You know, the drops of humidity together with a certain anger of the light coming in so that  can be reflected towards us and then the rainbow appears. And this, the Buddha knows all the time. He knows that all phenomena that will ever be experienced due to the coming together of conditions, which are changing, and in themselves, ungraspable. And this is the understanding of the equal nature of all phenomena. And then the Buddha is not only  spacious, fluid and knowing this equal taste, but also has the capacity to finally differentiate. It's not that everything is just of equal taste and then there are no more differences. There is a quality which remains when desire dissolves. You know, desire? I don't know what your desires might be. I mean in our country  Desire for example goes for different shades of good bread or good beer. In France it goes different shades of cheese and wine. And everyone in the world specializes in desire for certain kind of male or female and so on. People on earth, we have our preferences. and the capacity of desire is  limitless differentiation. You know, this is fine, but not yet fine. It could be also, it could be this and more and more. You know, and this capacity, actually of clinging, clinging desires clinging, but it uses the capacity of the mind, which is our capacity to finally differentiate phenomena. And this, this all distinguishing Finally this  that remains with the Buddha. A Buddha, because, that means an awakened being, because of so finely listening, so finely observing, uses this capacity to distinguish, to the utmost degree, and that's why an awakened being can give such good answers like we see in the Sutras. You know, when we read how the Buddha was understanding people...  where we would say, well, how could he even understand the question? Even the question is not clear to us, not to speak of the answer. And then you see the result of the answer and you see it is exactly fitting. And at the end of the Sutta, and this is also what they live with my teacher, at the end of any talk with anybody, the person would be happy and understand exactly what's going on. It's incredible, but an incredible capacity to differentiate to...  feel, then to find the appropriate words just finely differentiating which words are necessary and which are necessary. And this is the finely differentiating capacity of awakened mind. It's the purification of desire. Actually desire makes us blind normally in the normal world. And this blindness is gone because there's no more clinging. There's no more ignorance in the center, right? the quality.  of the mind is now used with full awareness. So this differentiating quality combines with seeing the ungraspable essence. So there's no idea that grasping onto something which we can differentiate would bring any more happiness. This is gone, it's finished. Yes? The full awareness completely fluid, seeing the empty nature of the phenomena can also finally disf-  This is something you will find with awakened people or people practicing a lot, their capacity to distinguish increases and increases, always becomes more fine. They are not losing that capacity. It is enhanced. It shows more and more. Why does it show one more? Because there is a less...  is clinging. There is less self-importance. So the doors are wide open that these natural capacities of mind that they can function really well. That's their natural capacities. They don't have to be created. They come, they come for us, they show as the ignorance disappears, as the awareness in general increases and also these other capacities of eyes. So now we...  done the center, the space like awareness, we have done the purification, this was the purification of ignorance, the purification of anger, the fluidity regained, the middle like awareness, the purification of pride, which is actually pride makes one very unstable, there's no more unstable person than someone with pride, you just need to poke him a little bit and he will explode an anger now you can sort the stability as  regained by seeing the empty nature of the self, of the person and of all phenomena. This one taste, this equal taste of all phenomena. This was the third battle, and now we were always the purification of desire. And that shows then as the all-differentiating capacity of mind. And that is likened to light, to fire. should know that.  Fire represents the sun and all other sources of light. So, the luminous nature of mind is exactly that which makes us perceive very clearly all the fine neurons, the fine shades of experience. It is that differentiating capacity that makes us feel over the time that we never have one single  breath which is identical to any preceding breath. Every breath is somehow slightly different and we can feel that. And this is all differentiating, finally differentiating quality. And we know that no day in our lives has been the same as any other day. And we can see this teaching this situation.  of listening also, it will never repeat again. And this is our finely differentiating quality, which knows that, which can see the difference with everything else. Like, if you light a fire in darkness, suddenly you can see, you can see all the shades, all the differences, the more it becomes by, the better you can see. And this is, that's why the reason of purification of desire His liken to the element.  of fire, of light. And then we have one more pedal remaining. We have the pedal of jealousy, you know, this other aspect of comparison. We have that remaining. And jealousy, rivalry, envy in the world, and it is very strong in our world. This is, which makes for all the competition and the world for the rivalry  for wanting what belongs to someone else, for many of the wars, it's due to pride and jealousy, you know, and desire and worship, that's all of them is there, but it is actually the competitive energy of our consumer society, you know, if I, you know, to strive to be the better one, to be the best and so on. All this very active energy of trying hard to...  get what others have to outshine them and so on. This is the rivalry jealousy part. It also has another part of pulling others down. It also has that side, but it is really this. It's a very active form of engaging in the world with lots of ambition. And if I can't put myself up, then I pull others down. and never satisfied the...  This emotion, this clasher of jealousy has this character always feeling that something is missing. It's incredible. It drives us nuts. Difficult to find peace because, you know, I don't know how it is for your husband or for you know, cannot sit still because the roof needs to be repaired or the car needs to be done or this  It's all yourself, oh, I need to do this. Always something needs to be done. Always busy, always, always going. Never good enough. That's the energy of jealousy. Never good enough, never satisfied. Now, when that is purified, Grab this, come.  complex of habitual tendencies, jealousy, envy, rivalry, ambition, and that is purified. We call that aspect of the enlightened experience the all accomplishing timeless awareness. There are two meanings to that. The one meaning is that the feeling of this satisfaction has completely gone. awareness make  gives the feeling that everything is accomplished. Nothing is missing. Nothing needs to change anymore. And this is also where Dogtchen, the great perfection, has taken its name from it, from this aspect of the awareness, that the awakened person has no more drive, no more need to go anywhere else, to achieve any goal, to make the world at world any better.  This has completely finished, this maniac drive of our society to always try to improve and with this wish to improve, making everything worse. It's like this has completely finished. There is satisfaction in the here and now. This is the one aspect of all accomplishing activity awareness. And then we come to the activity aspect because  awakened beings, like the Buddha and so on, all these generations of wonderful masters, they had an activity. But this activity was not nourished by a dissatisfaction, by an edinus. There is no need to be loved. There is no need to be more rich. There is no need to be praised. There's no need.  to be successful in a big project or something? No, there's no need even to leave traces in the world. The activity of Buddhas, and this is the other side of the all accomplishing awareness, it's the creative side of awareness. It is a creativity that comes out of the spaces, Flute, find a different setting.  awareness which knows the equinege of all phenomena. So it is not driven by any form of ignorance. Actually, the activity of an awakened being is to manifest that great perfection, to live that state of being when nothing needs to be accomplished anymore, and to radiate that into the world. So the teaching or the...  The creativity of an awakened being is to help others to see that they don't need anything more than what they already have. Their mind. The mind is the wishful feeling jewel. And this is the creativity, the creativity of an awakened mind is to have all beings to realize their own mind as the wishful feeling jewel. And that's the end of any feeling of need.  of want, of poverty, you know, all of that is finished. So this is the all-accomplishing aspect of awareness which makes that possible. And it is like it to the wind. The element of activity is actually like a natural breeze, you know, it's like it's a wind, it's the creativity. It's the...  It's the natural wind flowing through, without an intention, and inspiring everyone to enter the Dharma, to enter into that knowing of one's own mind. And it's effortless. This wind, this karma, this is the karma family I'm talking about, this enlightened activity is completely effort.  because there is no need for the person, for the awakened one, to do it. There's only a natural response to the situation. And it's this effortless aspect of creative awareness that is called this all-encompassing, timeless awareness. So now you have a little bit of taste of where we are going to. Okay.  Yes, it's this fivefold timeless awareness and all these five they manifest together. You cannot separate them. It's not that they come one after the other or you have one at a time, they always come together. It's one mind and it's your mind. It's your mind when all fields are putified, when all obscurations are gone, then our mind is  like that. Spaces, fluid, without grasping because of seeing the ungraspable nature, finally knowing our nuances, and in a natural movement of serving the situations all around, nothing holding back the natural activity of the mind. This is how we are. This is now the explanation of what we really  mean by Buddha nature, you know? When I started the first teaching, I think I started with something like that. And then of course I couldn't give you the whole meaning, I just said that are inherent qualities and you may be thought first, oh, when I relax, then there comes the generosity and I mention things like this, there comes love and compassion. But the truth is that that is now feeling of love to...  generosity and compassion arising in an awakened mind. It is simply these five aspects of awareness operating by themselves. There's no sentiment there. I love you and you love me. No, no, it's not like that. It's much more free than that. And it is without a self. Okay, so that is the Mahamudra tantric way of presenting reality.  and then if you move further into Tansar, then for each of these petals you have different Buddha aspects which you can practice, who develop these aspects of understanding a little bit more. But that is not for us. Yes. Okay. So, that was a little teaching for tonight. Bye bye.  I don't ask if you have questions. There's no need to have questions. You will discover that. And for me, the beauty is also that it is so, so well linked to the five elements. For me this is a great joy because the five elements are all around us.  The center, I go like this, now that you can see from your side, the center is Ways Water Earth On your right side The lower side fire  When, on the left side, make the word anger, ignorance, desire, pride, ignorance, jealousy. It's like a cross.  Yes, the center of the cross is the ignorance. We developed this approach in psychotherapy called essential psychotherapy, a Buddhist I'm sorry.  a TADAP, and it is based around these five emotions and the five aspects of time is awareness and uses these steps to work with emotions that I have just described in the previous teaching. It is very, very useful because you can work with the emotions without the need for clinical diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis you can still do.  But for the practitioner, we don't need this complex clinical diagnosis, I just need to know, oh, pride. And now, the many, the many fault manifestations of that are becoming expert in the emotions. They become an expert in what state of mind manifests when the emotion is gone. It's always the same state, but with...  slide, you know, like when the anger goes and the anger is dissolved on the spot, then the amazing experience is that the moment the anger is gone, the mind has regained its complete fluidity. And that's because before I felt so stuck and when the anger is dissolved, The amazing thing is that the fluidity has gone. When the...  Light is deserved. The amazing thing is that my eyes open to the equality of everyone and everything. When the desire is gone, the amazing thing that happens is that there is such a deep enjoyment of the diversity of life. Oh, these different shades, the beauty of life. Do you know? the same when the jealousy is gone. Wow.  that liberates an activity for the benefit of all which is not based on needing to change someone, something or someone or making it better. So, behind that there is also the amazement that this is possible where just before there was an emotion that blocked exactly that and the moment that is gone, wow, that natural quality appears. Without needing to you  produce just by the disappearance of one that aspect arises. Okay, let's meditate a little bit together.  I'm going to put it on the table. I'm going to put it on the table.

    "48.mp3": " So, with my heartfelt thanks and wishes for the continuation of this wonderful Dharma activity and tovana. I just want to leave my little copy here with your library. Oh, it is to the community of tovana with my heartfelt wishes for the continuation of you  is wonderful Dharma activity. Tillman, so now I'm Lindrup. I would give you also this one, but I have put some notes in there and that's why I cannot leave it. It feels like we are back together, right? I'm here.  here. I thank you for your patience. Our bank account wasn't used to this rainfall of Dana and somehow probably some bank or German security intervened and make the whole thing slow down and block for a while and then it opens or we call to Germany and we knew or it is working but it is just a  of protection measure, not to have something like a computer generated. You know, sometimes they flood a bank account with just smallest transfers of money like you know, five cents transfers and so on and this way you can actually flood and block a bank account. So probably there there must be security matters like this. But you were not sending 5 cents, I know.  So, thank you so much and even for those who weren't able to complete. For me, there's absolutely not the slightest trace of, how you say, restlessness or something. Do it, do it when the time has come. The time will come at some point, it always comes. Okay  wish to give a little talk, a final talk, then we go into groups of three for the short time and then we will sit in a circle. We will try to make a circle or double circle, yes, and share. And how it will end the daily life. I already talked But  yesterday night and this morning was the relationship to time. Also this morning I didn't roll out of bed, it was warm enough to just now blanket, now blanket to keep, now blanket to go, just get up and okay. When talking with Steven during the days that he spent with us, then  His wish was that I continue to like give a little maam udra who on the basis of your repassana practice. So the idea is that your basic practice doesn't change. If you ask yourself how to continue with practice, it is the same as before. However, you have failed some inspire.  coming through some of the instructions of the guided meditations, they gave you a taste of a way to meditate that could be a little different and maybe a way to look, which is a little different. But the basis is the same. And so in the future, I will try to continue like that. To just give...  an additional kind of inspiration, like a little enhancement of the view, a little more understanding of the workings of the mind from a different angle. So when you return and you think of this retreat, then don't think what shall I practice now of what was taught here. Yes, you have received some techniques, some methods you can.  apply everything that you have received. So whether it is the big belly breathing or the tongue-line in this safe way which I told to you or whether it is resting in the quality of the mind which is more than just choiceless awareness with the sensations is actually not even paying attention to the sensations but resting in the quality of perceiving of  So, yes, you have been introduced to that, you can incorporate that in your practice. But then, come back to your mindfulness of breathing, aware of the step-by-step, the Satyipatana practice. I still have to learn so much about how normally here in Togana meditation is taught. I know it from friends of the teachers here in Europe. But I...  Of course, every place and every teacher has personal ways of explaining. And that's maybe the reason why also it was a good idea that I come here, that it's just a different person coming with a different life experience. And then this adds just another shade or another, it shines a light from yet another angle. That's what I meant. And yes, I'm very much aware that there is.  You are so much talking, yes, and that I stretch the limits of your capacity to hear words. It's not so bad. I knew that I needed to do that. If we were to continue now,  would become more silent, this clear heart would become the ground is established and then one doesn't continue talking all the time. No, no, and things are clear, they are clear and then you practice. But I knew that with the habitual one hour talk per day in the classic, repassionary treat, I would never have been able to do justice to the many people who came for the weekend and even with some  nine such talks, you cannot cover the ground that we have covered in all those guided meditations and the explanations and flowing through. So at least you got a taste of the world of Mahmoudra. And we focused on the view, which means we focused on insight. How we focused on understanding our I'll take this. Looking.  Looking at the empty nature, looking at timeless awareness, the five aspects of timeless awareness, looking into some very provocative, basic meditation instructions like the Six Dhammas of Tilo Bomb. it was all about establishing trust. Establishing trust.  and how the mind is when it relaxes. Because this is the strong point of the Mahmoudra approach that shamatha, including the Janas, they are all practiced through relaxation, through not wanting, because they come by themselves. They come by themselves when we relax, the obstacle.  to their arising. So, and it is also one of the hallmarks of the Mahmouda tradition that always inside will accompany the shamatha practice. So, we practice the unity of shamatha and vipassana. So, karma-biting plus insight always together. So, even the janas will be practiced and they seem to to afford that this teacher Robb is his name, yes?  that he was also teaching in this way that, you know, how to enter deep calm of mind with the help of insight. And we were actually, we were actually preparing the ground for that. If you do Self-retreat, if you have the time, then what you can do is to give the inspiration of these exchanges which were  you can use one of the books that we're lying here, but advice you to start with the easier one, with this one here, hard advice of a Mahmoud or teacher, by Gennan Rinpoche. There there is a section on meditation, a larger section in there, and it has everything necessary that you need to know for this coming year of practice. If you're interested to keep that, then everything is in there, and big...  because this book is more than a meditation manual. It gives the four basic thoughts, a very huge bodhicitta. It gives some ideas about preparing for dying. It gives some ideas about how to integrate it into working with emotions. It is more complete than this other one, which is very specific, giving the structure of the Mahamudad tradition. Now, I didn't give you so much structure. I'm sorry.  offered you the beginning, this threefold understanding of the ground, Buddha nature, the path, unveiling the Buddha nature and the fruit, Buddhahood, that means awakening. Then we looked more into the path and there I explained to you, view meditation activity. We did have us.  But within that I didn't offer you more structure. It was, you know, I didn't talk about the stages of the path or how one's a matter of practice builds up on another practice, you know, meditating with the support, auto support, inner support, and so on. there is a progression how to go through the nine stages of the puzzle of camera biting or the eleven stages of insert and so on all of the  I spared you with that. Yes, it's not neat. It's not neat. We were in a pretty spontaneous approach, spontaneous, but not without a structure inside of me. Maybe you noticed in some moments that I can at any time just go into a structure and give you an explanation on this and that and at times The same things are used when we were going to the 5 Scunders.  relation to the five aspects of time as awareness, then okay we can go for it. But with the most important aspect here of what we shared was that this was my first retreat in Israel. It was my first contact with you people coming from different horizons within your own community and then my  being a newcomer and needing to feel and to allow myself to follow the intuition of what I feel and what I receive in the contact with you. So for me actually my learning process was happening a lot in the one-on-ones, a lot in the questions you asked, the group, the group situations, it happened a lot by looking into your eyes or in your faces.  and seeing how you meditate, how you respond to different aspects of the teaching. For you, from your side, it was perhaps the first contact with Mahmoudra, with that kind of approach. But of course, I'm just a small size Mahmoudra practitioner. So just you got a little taste of it, and it's yet different if you encounter the masters. and  But for you also it was new and you needed to check me out. I felt as very much in the beginning how you were checking me out and And sometimes you still do it's not finished and I still do I also Still fear it doesn't stop. I don't think I know you. I don't think I know the situation So this was a learning situation. It was a first time time together.  Let's make prayers that there will be a second and a third time and so on. Here's let's hope for that because I'm not the kind of person to start and then to abandon or something. You know, it's like we were kind of on the hook. Yes. I'm mutually inspired. And I want to tell you that I'm really inspired by you as people, as in...  videos that are sitting here, I'm very inspired, not only by my two colleagues here and by Stephen of course and others whom I've met from the staff and so on, I'm very inspired by so many of you. with how much courage and wisdom you go through these difficult times. How are you?  very wise in dealing with that, which shows also the decision to come to such a retreat, but then to open up to something new in the middle of all of that. And your honesty, your authentic practice, very touched. If you're very much at home with you, this is definitely true. and  And I appreciate also the work you did so far already in preparing your Dharma understanding. So there is really something for most of you or something to rely on, something which is established through your work with the teachers. And then my improvisations, my Dharma improvisations, Therefore onto a third-high field.  in the North, like your minds are able to take it with enough sense of discrimination to know, okay, it's one Dharma, the basic Dharma is the same, and then there are here and there some additional new ways of looking at things. And your willingness to work with emotions is very touching. We didn't do it.  so much of that and I'm still cautious. In a group situation, to start working with emotions is very delicate because it might be very helpful for almost everybody and then at some point somebody just goes off into a difficult state where, because it's a group somehow the guidance is not appropriate. there would be need for cloths.  up guidance and follow up. But in general you were very, very much willing to do that. And also what touched me and I think this is very much due to this whole Sangha atmosphere that you keep and you try to find it again and again, you keep an open heart. You don't completely loose hand. Here's not completely.  And you find back into this open-hearted attitude and you come here in order to do that, in order to give yourself a relief, to get out as much as it is possible out of this stress. And you know, actually, yes, there is something which wants to flower in you. And this readiness is willing  as to laugh together in order to enjoy the beauty, the little signs of beauty, the many signs of respect that I saw, the devotion in your hands, the devotion for the Dharma, the gratitude for also my coming. I was very touched of course by your gratitude. So all of that, this is my experience of being with you. It was, I was walking on.  out of the hall this morning and I was thinking, where I don't know how much you have learned, but I'm probably the one who has learned the most, which is often a privilege of the teachers, because in this sensitive exchange, this, you know, going into the resonance and then going into one's own Dharma experience and knowledge and then trying to find out what fits the situation as an immense learning rhythm.  happening. And when the situation is unknown, as this one, the learning is top, yeah, is incredible. It's so much which is going on. So I'm also very grateful to you to have been so patient and so open and so welcoming and so on to allow for that sharing to happen. and ask just what to express that to you.  And now we go into groups of three. And I give over to Lila, yes? Lila, you guide this process, you know, how it is usually done and maybe we limit the time so that we can then come back into the big circle. to worry about the transition.  before we go into the circles of three, most of you have not spoken a word, hopefully. In this period of time and the transition into speaking, let's take it really, really gently. And just one step back before that, I would like to encourage you If they...  Anything in this teaching touched you, and I'm sure it did for everybody. Keep it alive. Keep it alive. Don't let it be just as an amazing experience, touch the heart somewhere in our crazy lives here, but actually make it into a priority. Every day  spare some time for this, as in addition to our regular practice, but something in what Salamatilman was saying, something in the view, in the actual techniques, in the different concepts, maybe take a few moments to go into it, maybe read the books. And in that way, Make it your own. Make it your own.  your own, because for many here it was really new. And the question will be coming up and bubbling how to incorporate this into our daily lives. And the answers will come with the questions and with the mind that is inquiring and curious. So that's an encouragement to go on into it.  And of course, I would love to see Lama Tillman come more and more. We are thinking about it, seeing how it's going to happen. And I would love to see more and more of you practicing. Just going into the Dharma, we need each other in that sense. So it's just a reminder. We all know it, but a reminder of what we share here together and how precious it is.  Good time to go for trisms. We take really few moments for this and it's in your hand to make sure that everybody speaks, like maybe two or three minutes each and reflect upon something that really touched you or made a change or was precious to you during this time.  now. And the retreat that you would like to share it. And oftentimes it's the case that when we speak something up, it becomes even more ingrained in our system. And also it's a dana act. We share it with others. So it's also for them. So look around you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Later. So, we'll go back to...  So, what is the most important thing to do? What is the most important thing to do? The most important thing. So, what is the most important thing to do? And the most important thing to do is to get rid of all the problems that are happening in the world. What is the most important thing to do? What is the most important thing to do? What is the most important thing to do? What is the most important thing to do? What is the most important thing to do? What is the most important thing to do? What is the most important thing to do? What is the most important thing to do? and if you are going to be able to get a little bit more, it's very...  And then, I was told to be a teacher in the middle of the lecture, and I was told to be a teacher in the middle of the lecture that we would like to be able to do something that we would like to do and we would like to do something that we would like to do, that's the first thing we would like to do. So, we would like to go to the middle of the lecture and to the middle of the lecture. And we would like to be able to do something that we would like to do. You would not want to be able to do something that you would like to do, and the next day.  So, you tell me, Lisha and Chora, we are all friends here. Because I teach you the Z, and sharing. Sharing is caring. They say in India. So like this. Yeah, it's clear. See the people around you with you. It's good to have groups of three. And if you don't have your couple with you, you just raise your hand and we can help.  And we will ring the bell in nine minutes. Israeli time. Israeli time. And it means you have two, three minutes for each person. Okay? Two times a lot of the code, call it, call it. This is still on.",
    "8.mp3": " One question which I received by a little paper note was if I could talk a little bit about this finger of the old lady pointing to the moon. So just to say in different words this The basic idea is when the odd lady says, look at the moon, then of everyone of...  us we will not look at the finger, although she is pointing with the finger, we will follow the indication of the finger and then over there we will see the moon. So the same is with the words. When I was teaching now, I am using words, but these are finger pointers, these are pointers to something you have to kind of follow the trajectory, you have to follow that direction and then behind the words.  you find what is being meant, but this is you have to look for yourself. And maybe in the example, why old lady, because it's not even a straight finger where you can say, is pointing exactly to the center of the moon, actually, it's a very relaxed pointing, and it points just about in the direction, but not exactly. There's not even an intention on the why in the mind.  of the one point in to make it absolutely exact and precise, because there is a knowledge that it is anyhow by your own intuitive perception that you were know. So that's the meaning of this example, just to say it may be a little bit more precisely. Any other questions? Yes, please.  Yes, the question is, and the doctrine passed that are pointing out instruction, is it the same in Mahamudra? And yes, that are pointing out instructions in Mahamudra. Now there is the possibility that when practitioners have really done the preliminaries, have prepared themselves and once they are ready, not before they have completed with...  long time of practice of Guru Yoga, then the Lama calls them and gives the pointing out instructions. Now this is not what we would do here, we would have to wait quite a while before the situation is ready. So the pointing out instructions, they happen in between. They happen spontaneously and if you're ready you will get them. But yes indeed my teacher was this one here, can the  but he was not giving any teaching without some pointing out instructions somewhere. And those who were in a kind of meditative state or really receptive, then that would work. Yes. Yes.  So, I think that you have to use the kind of a good tool for the last time. That's a good, good, like, a good tool for sure. Like, how do you do it? So, it's time. It's time. I understand you. I repeat your question as good as I can. I will do this every time for the recording and that you understand in the back of the room. So, you are a little bit, You feel less grounding.  because you are used to this goenka style very clear, precise instructions. And here we talk about the nature of mind and about this and that, and it's all very much floating. And I can sympathize with that. And I can't even promise that I will become so much more specific. I will try. I've been brought up in that tradition as well as I mentioned. It's just the colleague of goenka with Mother Sayama in which it is, I was practicing. So.  Yes, we do have a lot of precise instructions in the Mahmouda instructions and I will share some with you. I also felt it's the time now that I've kind of set the frame and I've made you float a little bit, you know, and I know that it's uncomfortable because I have not been precise like do this, do that, and so on, not like this, but I will give you more hints of how to actually use your mind.  And then when the mind frame is set, when the basic understanding of refuge is there, of bodhicitta, about the nature of mind, when the view and the attitude are established, then it makes sense to give more energy into the precise practices, like for example, walking meditation or awareness of breathing, you know, because then all these precise exercises, there were f***  an inspiration with the new kind of view and attitude. So I needed to be making you a little bit, you know, loosening up from this kind of feeling. This is how it has to be, but going to a very intuitive field and then within that we can come to very precise instructions. So I'm sorry for that, discomfort. I will do my best.  for those who can stay for the week, then definitely you will get a taste of precise instructions. In a weekend, it is to be clear that we first need to talk about the view and the attitude, especially when I come into a completely unprepared context where most of you have never heard of Mahamudra. In a normal teaching situation to introduce Mahamudra in the weekend, there would be a  at least six hours of teaching every day, 12 hours altogether, minimum, plus the practice. And so on. We are adapting to that. What is possible here and what is your normal surrounding? And my wish is that you do not hesitate to fall back to use the practices that you have learned here, because they are fine. You use these practices that you are familiar with.  And with the time, you will add a little different way of doing it. There will be a slight change in the way you apply those instructions. Just to give you an example, we have in the Vipassana, we have this very precise, close on following of all the mental movements. And we go to a very rapid, very precise, rapid, clear presence.  noticing all the movements. Now this, yes, is possible, you experience that also in the Mahmoudra, but the focus will be one on not noticing the movements but noticing how everything dissolves by itself and that spaciousness. So there's not the idea that one has to follow very closely, but as immediately as they arise, they dissolve and already give space to the next 6 p.m.  So, in the Mahamudra view, we don't talk about moments of experience. There are no moments. No one can find a moment. There's only this ongoing experience. So there's no talking about being precise one moment to the next and so on. It's always this, in the continuity of the experience, in the continuity of the ever changing now. So this is why there will be changes. You okay?  continue all the time is what you have learned. It's absolutely helpful. My advice to Mahamudra practitioners is go and do several of those Gengkha courses. Go and do really down to earth, we pass on our courses. This is where you learn how to sit, you know, and you learn the basics. So don't fly off in Mahamudra cloud number nine whatever you call it yes  And stay on us, watch your breath, watch how you walk, you know, do all of that. That's very, very important. I hope I answered a little bit. A question? Yes. Please.  Yes, I noticed that. Yes. What he is saying just to everybody, am I allowed to repeat what what you're saying, yes you were feeling like very activated HD, ADHD so hyperactive.  and I started talking and your mind went off and you weren't here during the rest of the talk. I noticed that also during the meditations, so how can we connect? How is that possible? Do you have an advice for me or a suggestion? It's okay. I know this phenomena happens that are different.  possible explanations for that. Now that's why I need to know you a little bit more because I would hesitate to give any of those explanations without knowing you. I just observed that because you're sitting in my feet of vision. So I was very much aware of that. What is most interesting to you? Why did you come here to this course maybe I can more answer your  but you wish that brought you here. Okay, welcome. I give you another two days. Good. We have a rendezvous. Okay. Good. Please.  I wanted to ask about the infection and the health. We were talking about, you know, maybe the infection can be still, but also the vision that we have had there, experience, experience, the life experience. And this curious, you came to our about the health. What did you expect in the event? Like, there's a good experience in the event. And the... Mm-hmm. Are you yourself also?  or therapists, psychologists, or something like that? No, but you're interested in that. OK, sorry, to repeat the question, if I could talk more about the self, the seeming self, and at the same time, I talk about this experience, this character, personality sense. And so how does this fit together also for my understanding as a therapist? OK. Basically the first thing one has to...  say, when nowadays, modern psychotherapy or psychology talks about itself, they don't talk about the solid self anymore. This is out. Since 30, 40 years, no one talks about a solid self, but about a dynamic self. It's a dynamic learning self, always changing, capable to adapt to situations. So when you...  This is all the development of Sikman Freud's first talking about, you know, the self in the sense of I, the S, the It and the Super Eagle, yeah, the Bivaih. Then from that onwards, with Anna Freud, with his daughter and with other psychotherapists, they brainstorm.  into a description of self as being a sum total of capacities to love, to enter into interaction, to make sense of situations, to master challenges, to, you know, and they were defining the capacities of what is called a sound self. I'm going to zoom this in here, a sound I, we say I can German language. And this.  What they describe as a sound self, actually this Ichpsychology, the psychology of the self finishes up with eight stages of development from a very narrow perspective of self, very egocenter, to an always more integrated sense of self, always more capable to take in different views and increased sense of flexibility without ever losing ground. And this...  modern definition of what is a self and psychotherapy, this is now shared by all the other approaches, this is not something which is discussed, this is actually describing the way of Dharma practice, it is actually a gradually loosening of a narrow sense of self to an integrated personality. I wrote a whole chapter about that in my book on Buddhist psychotherapies.  psychology. It is actually a way of describing also how narrow-mindedness disappears with the capacity of integration, getting more and more, the fluidity of mind, a deep emotional stability, and then of course the path of awakening continues further even than that. On that perspective you would say a Buddha completely awakened.  has the most sound and stable ego of everybody. Because of not clinging to a self, that's why there is this ability and this capacity of integration, this capacity to love this even the, you know, even to the point of unconditional love. So these are all signs of an incredible development of the self. And some people and also some Buddhist trends and tantra, like they call it the true self.  They use this term which is out in the normal televised and approach you would never talk about the true Self, but in Tantra you do, and it's like Vamanamahashi, you know? It's a advaita Vedanta that you also talk about the true Self, but it is not individual, it is not personal, it is universal. And we talk about these universal qualities as manifesting due to the realization.  of the non-save of the small nettle. So you can say the limited aspect of our projections. So I hope to help you with that. That what we call non-save, Anata and Atman in the Buddhist tradition is actually the best possible way of developing that what others would call a true self-oil.  sound self. This is my understanding of it because none of these awakened masters have difficulties in saying, I and you and I will be there tomorrow, I will come and visit you next year, all the relative interactive capacities of safe and others, they are fully there and they are highly developed. So, we are not losing that capacity to...  communicate in the world with self and others. Actually we are gaining more and more flexibility. Okay, this needs to be as short as that would be much better. I look back there, yes, please. I saw one hand rising, yes?  You can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see the other one, you can see  And that is the idea. And then, what did the Buddha do after his Nirvana? He stayed around. Okay. And seemingly himself talked a lot about lifetime after lifetime coming back with developing this parameters, this parameters, and more and more. And this is the coming back, although there is already an experience of awakening. wake me.  It's an interesting perspective and that's why the Buddhists have developed this notion of Parianilvana, which is more definite than the Niharvana. But these are words. Basically, it is like this, I would say, that the initial experiences of awakening, like Probably you are familiar with like Sota, Parana, Stream, Ento and then. Yeah, like...  these, no you're not. Oh, okay, then I use different terminology. So when there is a first strong experience of awakening, already then, you know, this is a very surprising moment and you can't really describe it, but afterwards you feel that there's a change of perspective. And for some people this transformation is longer lasting and others they...  for a back quickly into a clinging again. It was nevertheless an authentic experience, but the power of transformation is usually not such that it has was just one experience of awakening that it is a definite new desire in which you could abide. I mean, 99.9% of practitioners is definitely not that. It is an experience, you fall back in your patterns, but you don't believe your own patterns. So  is like there is not that belief in one's own projections as it was before, their weaker. And even if you get angry, you don't believe you're on anger as much anymore. If you're full of desire, you don't believe you're on desire anymore, your pride becomes hollow. It's like, and then when you continue practice, you make these experiences again and again, and it becomes more stable, their transformative power increases. And this is what we call a graduate.  The experience of Neade Vahama, because that is undoubtedly an experience of true awakening, but it's not stable. And that's why there's a coming back, and then it has to stabilize sufficiently before you take the risk of another rebirth. Because if it's not sufficiently stable in this life, you better don't take the risk to come back. Yes, you have to be able to contact.  that easily on your own if possible, without the help of many teachers who point out and help you to get there. So that is the reason why Buddha sat was in order to come back. They should develop actually in this life already a reliable realization. So their experience of Nirvana has to be reliable enough to risk coming back. And in those approaches, those teachers will stay better, Take care.  to get out of here, out of the Samsara, then they are more realistic because they estimate fully well the great danger of interacting with other mind streams with full of emotions and projects and getting caught yourself again, if you are not stable. much for now. I see too please look where...  of you will talk first. And there was a word, do you have a, did it go to reach Nirvana? Very good question. No. Because I trust it.  already there. Is that okay? Are you okay with that answer? Okay, now this has stopped. I'm not going for a new one anymore. I was once very motivated, yes.  Yes, I might have missed another switch because of the distance. you  Your question is if in the Mahamudra we also pay a lot of attention to the breath, to the body, to the emotions, because the second part was sensations, sensations. And what's the second part of the questions on emotions? No, only sensations. Changing sensations in the body. Yes, you see in the Gwangka style approach, then you spend lots of time, you know.  going through the body meditating on all the sensations, and each other do a nata. Yeah, you go through many times, many times. And this was actually the main point of the practice. And we do that as well, but not as much. And why I had difficulties to understand you is that we would... This is again  How can I explain that? It's a similarity and a difference. If you remember the deeper instructions in the Goa Enca retreats, in these we pass them out retreats, then whenever the sensation arises, you are asked to remember that it is an Nietzsche, where it is impermanent, so it is changing.  You are asked to advise that clinging to any of these changing sensations is Dukha, and that any form of identifying with it, we create Moduka. And due to that, you are being asked or you are being encouraged to see that there is no self in this whole process of sensations arising and disappearing. up to there it's pretty much the same approach we would say  the Mahmouda and then we would say stop labeling. We would ask the practitioner to stop saying Anitra Dukar Anata to use any forms of labels to go into a direct perception of first of all the sensations, so physical sensations, directly entering as much as possible the burning sensation, and the vibration.  everywhere, going into where it is the strongest, to see whether we can find a center. And then the next instruction would be go into the perceiver, go into the person meditating, that would be you, you trying to do well to follow these instructions, who is trying to perceive these sensations. We would go with our awareness, we would try to find where is the greatest  the intensity of that feeling that I meditate. And it's exactly there where we go with our awareness. And again, we can't find someone. So we purposely go into the illusion of the subject and the illusion of the object. And we investigate the empty nature of the one meditating, the one being so inspired to reach Navanna. We try to find that.  and we try to find if there is anything in the outer world and the world of experiences of sensations which has any substance. And then this way the Anata, the non-self of the person, the subject and the Anata, the Shunyata, the empty nature of all the sensations of all the experiences as realized. That would be the approach and my mother down.  want to follow up your question, did I, did I, did these words reach you? You create some understanding or? Yeah? Okay. It's different, right? Yes, then you get it. If you see that there is really a difference, yes. But it helped me a lot to have done these years of practice.  in the Saiyutva kin tradition. Help me a lot. And it's always a good basis on which I fall back in case I need. Yes, now it's your turn.  I didn't use the term, but what I described as Tancha Mahamudra, this is the Vajrayana. So it is Vajrayana is based on these visions, uses Mantras, uses visualizations and so on. So that's what we call Vajrayana. Sometimes translated as the Diamond Way, but actually Vajrayana, Yana means the vehicle or the path and Roger.  It's not a diamond, it means the indestructible nature of mind. It is pointing to that primordial, timeless awareness that is always there, completely reliable, it points to this ultimate refuge. So Vajrayana is the tantric Buddhist approach. Yes. Want to follow up the question or that  That's okay. Okay. Up you too  Why are you saying this is fine? It's a problem that you would be... Does it take a little bit more time to talk about it? The question is, I was talking about effortless meditation, and then when it was about these two obstacles to meditation, the restlessness agitation and the dynastlepiness, then I told you something about making the right effort, but you know, tensing a little bit.  I didn't say, focus the interest, work with the interest. So is the question is, is there interest without effort? Just look at your kids. Effortlessly, five hours, five hours. You know, whatever gadget they have, they can spend endless time.  playing with them. The interest is so great that somehow they don't seem to get tired. Well, that's maybe a bad example because it's an example where interest is motivated by desire. So it doesn't lead out of some sort. It doesn't lead to a deep realization. No one has gotten awakened, huh, with the tablet or whatever, yes, with a joystick and so on, whatever.  So, the art of developing and a relaxed interest that does not create an artificial unnecessary effort is really something we need to learn. I'm not saying that it is easy. Normally, the moment we are interested, it is like, the body makes this movement and the The mind makes the same movement.  It tenses a little bit, it goes into a direction. Now, what we can learn to relax and to be interested, for example, I'm really interested what happens in the right, you see it's just moving a little bit. I'm interested to see what is happening in the right corner of my eyes and stay really relaxed, but very attentive. So although you were really at the very edge of visual perception,  The field of perception was so large, my mind was relaxed and fortunately enough he was just moving. So it was possible to perceive that. And somehow it is this relaxed interest that we learn and order not to go the past with a lot of willpower and then producing some salad again. an inspiration, a joy.  This is why joy is so important in the practice because it creates this natural interest. Compassion, love, there are these, if they are, how do you say? If they become the motivating forces, instead of wanting to reach a goal oneself, then the practice becomes easy. So there would be a lot to say about the art of...  finding that motivation that is not immediately leading to a narrowing of one's attention, one's mind. And that's, I want to communicate that to you, but of course it's not so easy. Second one, yes.  and I'm sorry, I don't think it's like that, but from the seventh of the program, I was frustrated. And I'm confused if I understand some sort of how to not be fit. But my forte is effective. And totally, you know, you're frustrated. You might be soft, you know. Except you might be trying to say it, but I suppose it's a game that became. you  We are talking about an experience shared by many people in the world. There are many sevens October happening in this world. and millions of people on all sides have lost trust everywhere.  And this is maybe the greatest damage that has happened, that it is yet more difficult. Also, obviously, reaction, you know, the bombarding which has happened since then, there is more and more people losing trust all over the world, not even those who are bombarded and who are doing the bombarding everywhere. well, you know, not only those who were in the keyboard seems which were, you know, we're all of...  that happen. But we have this phenomenon and you know that it's going on all over the world, unfortunately. Now, may I take your question further, you were living by the trust and you probably look for the way to find a more realistic trust or to live by the trust again on a new level of understanding or... I ask you...  I don't believe in trust. Even though it's this time, I try to understand the care of my property, but I'm not I get you better now.  Now the question is she wants to understand the gap between the mind and the body because the body showed the signs of losing the trust and shock maybe. Yes, and the mind still feels just there is the possibility of trust. And the body usually is a perfect mirror what has happened unconsciously, subconsciously to us. body cap.  not lie. The mind can make its own scenarios and can continue with a way of seeing and believing and so on, but the body shows signs of stress, deep stress. And now we are talking of stress all over the world. Persecute us, persecuted everywhere in the world. Yes? We talk about  individuals, we talk about groups of people, we talk about nations, we talk really everywhere in the world, this is now happening and it has happened. And the body shows the science and although you try to, you know, you try to Light and up your mind the body is exhausted. It has...  of stress and cannot sleep and is maybe has lost appetite or whatever, pains everywhere and so. So the way to deal with that has to go through a combined approach of body and mind. Yes, I have to take that into account. And it takes...  It takes a very deep, honest approach. What you're describing is that you lift a traumatism. Yeah, this is called a trauma. And it is that the body still reacts and we know this from people who have been attacked or who have been in war as soldiers and who have had the bombs on their heads. And so on, I've just heard about it some people are traumatized by just...  seeing things on the screen. One doesn't have to have personally been there in order to feel the shock. So we are all participating in that. It's my sincere wish that I could talk to Palestinians that I would share the Dharma with them as well. It's my sincere wish. There's no taking of sides, even if I don't know how to use the examples in this audience, because every example I'm sorry.  is like full with potential trauma, retraumatization and so on. So I try to open up this perspective, but the healing process needs a safe surrounding and it needs a new integration of what one has lived, not negating it. Like you say, it has happened, but it is continuing to happen. It is gone.  continuing all the time now. It doesn't stop in the world. And you're not just to give you a little a different example, just to change your perspective. When there was this invasion and Tibet, monks were forced with guns pointed at them to violate nants or to shoot their Yeah.  sisters and brothers of the monastery, and many prefer to kill themselves instead of doing it. But atrocities have happened all over the world and they are happening all the time. Now when I teach, for me, I teach and the awareness that this is ongoing and that we can be lucky to have periods of peace. It can be very lucky. Now here in the middle  is you have not had long periods of peace. The solution is kind of there but no one is accepting the solutions, the possible ones. Very difficult. In that central part of you, there are come from these, got it now, 75 years of peace that we have had, have never happened before. It hasn't happened before that for example.  Germany hasn't had war for such a long period. And this tells me something about Samsara. It tells me something about the way this world works. ongoing strife. Everyone struggling for one's own way being. Groups getting together, interest groups, you know, clans, and so on. on nations, ethnics.  and always the same self-interest. So the trust we are talking about, the trust comes from experiencing the refuge, experiencing that safe place on our self, which is, you can say, our home, that dimension of being that will accompany us even beyond leaving this body. only way to  to really get out of that stress that everyone is experiencing here. No matter which ethnic group, which religious group, everyone is experiencing that stress. Basically, it has to do with a fear of annihilation, a fear of death. It has to do with the fear of losing all ones values of...  losing to first to fear, then of losing to anger, then of losing to self protection, all the things we don't want. They are all knock on the door. All these emotions, they are not knock on the door. And the fear is very much to get lost, to exactly that which I don't want, other to be killed, to be injured, to lose ones, to lose ones, very close ones, ones friends, ones relatives.  and to lose finally all confidence, all trust in the good side of human beings. And somehow it's the worst that can happen to us. So for some people it's worse than dying. If I could die with the trusting, the wonderful human potential. So the way of feeling is actually a very deep one that we need to work on all...  these fears basically overcoming the fear to die, basically touching in this wonderful source of qualities in us, to see that they have not gone lost, no matter how strong the shock, how strong the trauma, they are still there. They're here, right now, they're here in the room. and everybody and to find ways to relax into that again.  and again. And psychotherapy, we call this working with the resources. The deepest resources of human mind is the nature of mind. And that is from where the deepest healing can come. From that state or that dimension of being which is beyond all these hopes and fears. So to some extent our goodness, our belief and the  good side of humanity was based on unrealistic assumptions, on an unrealistic way of seeing humankind. My father, who was one of the soldiers, but also the victims of the war, he took us as children. He wanted us to see the concentration camps. He came 12 times to Israel. He bought students.  He wanted us to go to Madhaka, Aijieh, and so on. He, you know, go everywhere in the world to contact the different traditions and religions so that never such atrocities as in his time could happen again. This was an eye-opener for me early on. So I grew up with a constant awareness of what atrocities had happened in the lifetime of both of my parents. I'm sorry.  It helped me then again to meet that in the life story of our Tibetan teachers, who had lived such atrocities, who had run those who could, they ran away, they crossed the Himalayas, others couldn't, they had to leave behind their home. And then it was very comforting to me in a strange way to read that at the time of Buddha, got him up with them, that he had to...  witness the annihilation of the whole Shakyaklan. You know, he was the son of the regent of the Shakyas. He could avoid several wars because five Maharajas were his students. So when they started to fight with each other and with another one, sometimes he would appear in the right time and was able to avoid those wars. but he tried to avoid the war.  which destroyed his whole home, 70,000 shakias were killed in that time. And he lifted, he lifted through that catastrophe. They were all murdered by the neighboring clan. No way to avoid it, even a Buddha couldn't avoid it. And he tried. So reading that and knowing that the Dharma that we practice, That's not  come from a naive belief in the goodness of people, just because we want to believe it. Now it comes from a very clear estimation that we are maybe the most cruel being on this planet. And at the same time, have a potential for being so fantastic, so caring, so loving, far beyond and our bonds of blood and beliefs and ethnic sense on rehab.  We have an incredible capacity to grow beyond our normal limitations. And this is the twofold view of the human being, which is very typical for the Buddhist way of looking at the world. Non-na'if believes about what humans can do or cannot do. Everything is possible there. limits.  And then, seeing that this is not the truth by itself, there is a deeper truth which only reveals when you open up, when you relax. When you open up into that dimension which gives the real trust. So whichever horizons we come from, we have no other choice. We have to go into that dimension, which the Buddha called the death of the  state, that state which is free from hope and fear. And we learn to become familiar with that, and then not only trust arises, but a certainty arises. Yes, a certainty that it is like this. It's not a belief anymore. You can see it. You can feel it. You can see the people changing. Yes.  And this is wonderful, this is so great. It's never impossible, but you don't know when it will happen. You had a question, is it still appropriate? Another day.  What day is today? She is pulling the clock. You know? Yes, I am not supposed to be the precise one. If I do it the mom, would I start? You never know when it finishes. I tell you a story, since we have time. I tell you a story. You know about this crazy...  Kajilama, same tradition as myself called Trumpa D'Ampirechi. He was outrageous as well, living in the United States. Now he would do these dh\u0101t\u016bns. The m\u0101d\u0101 means d\u0101v\u0101 means moon, means one month, and two in the meantime sessions. So one retreat, one month. And when Trumpa D'Ampirechi was emperor visible, when he wanted to teach, then the gong would ring, and everyone would have to appear. and the meditate.  We are talking about 200s, 300 people doing the retreat together. I know the story from people who were there, yes? One of my closest friends was a very close student of Trumpa. And then just to tell you how Mahmoud Atee-Tur could be, in the middle of the night, two o'clock in the morning, the gong goes on. The gauntlet.  goes everyone wakes up, he wants to teach, rushing down to the meditation hall. Wait, wait, then after three quarters of an hour, Trump comes in, sits down and said, practice. Then he leaves. You know, it could be as crazy as that. With my own teacher.  The teachings would go hardly ever be below three hours on a stretch without a pause. But we never had teachings really with which were less than three hours. And he wouldn't leave us before all questions were finished. So here to say, time questions have to wait this didn't exist. It would just stay and this is why again I remember  When he died, when he passed away, I felt for many years, for about seven years, I felt like that I had no questions. I could have asked everything, we were about meditation, about ethics, about activity. It took a long time before I felt, But oh, this would be something I would love to talk with him about.  And it is this plenitude of, this is what we call a transmission. You know, this is, in the good old days, you live together and you spend hours without end and practice and ask, hear the teachings. So on and then you feel okay. Wow. And I'm talking about a period of 11 years, which was like that.  the first seven years I spent whole day in retreat. So it was 12, 13 hours of practice per day, every day, every day, every day without interrupt. And he would come into those retreats and would sit down. He would come and I'd built a little blockhouse and besides, as there were camping cars and we were sitting in the forest and meditating. The toilet was outside in the forest with no shower, just the hose, you know?  And he would come and he would start explaining, asking our meditation experiences, we would talk and then he would give answers to the experiences like I'm doing with my students usually. And he was so relaxed, he was laughing his heads off when we came with our experiences and then giving them the pointers how to continue. Sometimes he laughed so much that he was sliding off the sofa, you know. and valley was holding his...  knees so that he wouldn't fall for it. It was like very much a living room experience, like you would be sitting for a chat. At an any place it could happen, nothing very honorable and very, you know, like this. It was just a father talking to his children. That's the basic situation.  of transmission. I just wanted to mention that because that's the kind of background I come from.",
    "9.mp3": " Tonight I would like to share a guided meditation with you which is 2.5,000 years old. Probably the first one recorded in words history, it's the Anapanasati of the Buddha. So this will be responding to the need for some precise instruction. We will walk through the Anapak  In a more complete way than what you know from most of the traditional Granka retreats. Yannapana said, his return has originated on a full moon night in northern India. And it is one of the rare occasions, it's the only one that I know of, that the Buddha has announced a teaching. And here invited  the practitioners, monks and nuns, to come together for that full moon in the place, I don't know which place it was, whether it was Rajkirt or which place it actually was there for good, but he really gave them time, he gave them advanced notice two weeks so they could come from all the different places. and he sat down with the words we had.  in the introduction that so many are practicing this, you know, practicing on this kind of service, by practicing this and that, he was enumerating all the different teachings that he had given so far. And then some are practicing mindfulness of breathing, developing, cultivating awareness with the help of breath. And on that occasion then he guided  the practitioner through the 16 steps of Anapanasati, which in groups of four are exactly also what he taught in the Satyipataana and Mahasati-Pataana Sutta. Now again there's nothing new here, I will walk you a walk with you through the 16 steps probably and  But just maybe the taste, with which I'm doing it, is a little bit different. You will get a Mahamudra taste with these good or teachings, which are our common heritage. And so, I might make a break in the middle, but feel free to move, to change your position anytime you need, during the meditation and  Yes, if you feel like that, follow the steps and imagine now that we are together with the Buddha and at night and under the full moon, of course the noises were getting less and the Buddha could be heard very well as if with loudspeakers. And here now it's...  This teaching and everyone was very keen and would sit in meditation and the Buddha said, yes, settle on a comfortable seat, direct your gaze in front of you, but you may do this exercise also with closed eyes. However, he didn't say that.  Direct the attention and fund of you. And of course, letting go of all worldly concerns, if possible with crossed legs, In a secluded place, practice like this.  Breathing in. I know that I'm breathing in. Breathing out, I know that I'm breathing out. Breathing in deeply, I know that I'm breathing in deeply. using R2 plea.  That is this knowing that this is a long argument. So allow yourself to take a few deep breaths and follow them attentively. As if you're mindfulness.  Awareness, while riding on the breath. Never separated from the breathing experience.  Pay attention to the variations in breathing. taking a sharp breath now that this is a sharp breathing in and a sharp breathing out.  Sometimes longer and deeper, sometimes shorter. you  Many slight variations in breathing. Be aware as if writing the breath. you  Then the Buddha continues and says, breathing in, fear your whole body breathing. Breathing out, fear your whole body breathing. He uses the term Prana Kaya.  Kaya means body, Prana is breath and subtle energy. Our whole body participates in the breathing.  So I encourage you to become this breathing body, to feel it completely from within breathing in and breathing out.  Breathing in and breathing out, we fear all the physical sensations. I'm sorry.  And we feel them with this deeply equanimous attitude without any preferences. Thank you.  Breathing in we feel how the whole body is alive. So many sensations and they are all prana, they are all this vitality. out breathing in.  a breathing, very vital organism.  And since we experienced this without clinging and aversion, the physical sensations, the physical formations, they harmonize the prana flows more harmoniously.  Just continue with breathing in and breathing out, feeling the whole body and experiencing the equal taste of all these sensations. all the rice and the oil pass away. That's the equal taste.  Thank you.  And this breathing body is also hearing, seeing, smelling and tasting. These are also quite physical.  formations by the water. Breathing in and breathing out, be aware of all these physical formations without any clinging.  I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to put it on.  .  the breathing in and breathing out experience has become a good support. We will always return to it while exploring the rest of our experience.  The Buddha makes us notice that this equanimous breathing in and breathing out is not only calming the physical formations, but gives a certain joy to the mind. you  Such a sense of being more happy, more relaxed, more open. And he suggests that breathing in and breathing out we are aware of this sense of waving and the mind and then also  the body.  Breathing in and breathing out the experience, the joy of breathing. of being free of clinging to the physical...  information.  And now we are invited to turn our intention to the mental formations. movements of parts, imbalances, images.  labeling, knowing, a chirping sound to be a bird, all of that, this mental activity.  Building in and building out was the same relaxed attitude, we are aware of mental processes.  And in the Mahmouda tradition we would say we understand them to be also prana, moving energies.  Breathing in, breathing out. We notice the impermanence, the change in all these fluctuating experiences.  Now it has man's and no version. and everything.  out all these mental formations, unnoticed, experienced, and they pass on. They pass on without further comment.  you  I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.

With this spacious awareness in which all the mental movements can arise and liberate themselves. you  And the Buddha says, breathing in, we notice the pacification. the Buddha says breathing in, we notice the pacific cage.  of mental formations, breathing out, we notice how the mental formations become more calm.  Thank you.  I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page.

I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm going to go to the next page. I'm sorry.  And the Buddha then tells us to go still a little deeper towards a more subtle observation, to turn our attention to the mind itself. and everything art we're aware.  of just how the mind is. Is it relaxed or were the tense? wide, or narrow liberated  or stickling. And breathing in. And breathing out. We are complete the open way aware of how the mind is.  Right now.  And the Buddha says, then, in we bring joy to the mind, we bring out, we bring joy to the mind. is pointing to this deep relaxation.  deep openness towards the way we are. However the mind is breathing in, we relax the mind, breathing out, we relax even more.  you  you  We are waiting in, we calm the mind, we are waiting out, we calm the mind. This is simply the result.  of deep acceptance, deep relaxation, normal clinging, Now a version.  you  you  This peaceful mind can be a source of attachment. So the Buddha continues saying, we live our mind, we live our mind, we live our mind. We live our mind from all attachment to calm and peace. you  Just becoming natural. in and breathing out naturally.  I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom.

I'm going to go to the bathroom. you  And this natural undistracted presence also has a natural clarity. We are very aware.  of our experience. And we see, we see how it is.  But as is breathing in, we see breathing out, we see impermanence, we see the dynamic nature of life. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing.  We think in, we see that there is nothing to hold on to, nothing to grasp. Everything art, we see that there is nothing to grasp.  I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm sorry.  you  And since we see that there is nothing to grasp, but everything is changing. Nothing is permanent. Then breathing in and breathing out. We see that the grasping is getting less.  There's less and less clinging in the mind, less and less identification.  Breathing in and breathing out, we see the doka is getting less and less. The diminishing of stress caused us less and less clinging.  you  you  And if we were to continue as your gains, As your gains.  the August and the Augustines. We would see at some point the cessation. The end of our suffering. The end of our grasping. The end of our illusion.  you  And the Buddha concludes saying, breathing in and breathing out. We see just how natural it is. The full release, the fully released dimension of being.  you  you  you  I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm sorry.  And after that guided meditation the Buddha said practicing like that, you perfected seven wings of awakening, you perfect all the qualities you are liberated.  from all that needs to be liberated. And there is nothing to add. This is exactly how we can practice. The support here is the breath, but the support could be a different one. However, what we do while we practice, this can't be changed much. We have to somehow come to tell  with the physical formations, you know, all the senses, relaxing, all the grasping. We have to come to terms with the mental formations, all of what's happening in the mind. The relaxation has to go into the deeper layers of mind, you know, there where there are the most subtle tensions. Where we don't even notice movements. We just notice a certain way of being.  and attitude. We relax into that as well. This is beyond the easy to see conceptual mind. So the meditation goes into that non-conceptual area. And then in all of that we see the change, the impermanence, which is another way for seeing nothing to grasp it's like seeing  that there is no substance, no self in all of that. We become seeing. Yes, we are seeing. And that's the word Buddha changes there. We've always, we've found all the other instructions, he uses other verbs. And then when he comes to the last, the last steps, then this is Viparsana. This is the seeing that the Buddha is talking about. Seeing how it really is.  And this is what a Mahamudra is called sitting in the view, meditating in the view. So Mahamudra is practicing these last steps as the main practice. While there are a part that which is calming the mind, pacifying, accepting, opening up, this is the so-called preliminary. It's the Shammata practice. And then...  the actual seeing, this is the main practice. And to sit in what we see is exactly what you are being told, a normal repassana courses, see the impermanence, you know, see how it is. It is just happening. There is not my body, there is just physical experience, physical sense. There's not my thought, there's just thinking. Sit and seeing that.  sit and seeing just how it is. And then it will get deeper and deeper. And the grasping will become less, open states of mind become more. And this is how you can practice.  Do you have your microphone? I guess I'm supposed to say something. looking at your faces.  really enough. But I want to suggest that this step by step it can be very gentle walking the path and also actually by slowing down and really marinating.  in each and every step that we just heard and practiced. Remember it's very ancient and it's been working for so many people for so many years. Just slowing down and marinating in each and every step can be in and of itself a doorway, a path to freedom. So in a sense, yeah  it's a gradual practice and now we're going step by step, by step, by step. And yet, even the smallest step we take, and there's no eye and mind involved, where is the step and where is the practice and who is practicing? Be the key.  as well as many other arenas is to remember to let go, remember to let go deeply, to let go of the achiever of the meditator, of the one who needs to get somewhere. And at the times we can pick her up if we need to.  And maybe levitate, turn more towards the actual real experience, then the thinking about the experience or trying to understand the experience, which is also beneficial at times. You understand what I'm saying? It's kind of clear, right?  Okay? Kind of. Yeah. Good. Yes. I thought I would hear you singing better. Ready for little song, the third mantra, inauspicious.  I said to be what we pitted so that you can carry it home with you. That's a song of freedom. And of course, you can sing it also in a rap melody. Doesn't have to be slow and beautiful. It can have power also. Tonight again the slower.
